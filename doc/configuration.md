# Configuration reference

Full `contextPrune` settings, commands, footer widget states, spilled outputs,
and the summarizer-model-by-plan table. See the [README](../README.md) for the
6 knobs most people touch and the conceptual model; see
[PRUNING.md](../PRUNING.md) for the algorithm behind each setting.

## Full settings JSON

Settings live under the `contextPrune` key in `<agent-dir>/settings.json` (i.e. pi's own settings file). `<agent-dir>` is `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` if set, otherwise `~/.pi/agent`. Each pi preset gets its own settings, so you can run different summarizer models per preset.

## Every key

| Key | Values | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` / `false` | `false` | Master switch |
| `showPruneStatusLine` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Footer widget + queued-turn notifications |
| `summarizerModel` | `"default"` or `"provider/model-id"` | `"default"` | `default` = your active pi model. See [Choosing a summarizer model](#choosing-a-summarizer-model) |
| `summarizerThinking` | `default`/`off`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` | `default` | Provider-specific reasoning effort knob |
| `pruneOn` | `agent-message` / `on-demand` | `agent-message` | Trigger mode - see README Architecture section |
| `batchingMode` | `turn` / `agent-message` | `turn` | How coarse each summary is (independent of `pruneOn`) |
| `quietOversizedSkips` | `true` / `false` | `false` | Silences `skipped-oversized` / `skipped-trivial` info notifications |
| `minBatchChars` | non-negative integer, `0` disables | `1000` | Pre-flush guard - batches smaller than this skip the LLM entirely |
| `recoveryGraceTurns` | non-negative integer (user-turn-groups), `0` disables | `3` | After a `context_tree_query` recovery, render that tool's output verbatim for this many user-turn-groups before re-stubbing it. Enforced at render time (Phase 1 + chain-compression eligibility), not at capture time. See [PRUNING.md § What Pruning Does](../PRUNING.md#what-pruning-does) |
| `summarizerIdleTimeoutMs` | non-negative integer (ms), `0` disables | `20000` | Abort a summarizer stream call after this much silence (no stream event). Resets on every event, so it never false-aborts a flowing generation; catches a stalled connection fast. A timeout feeds the same outage-fallback retry as a provider error. `0` = no idle bound. |
| `summarizerMaxTimeoutMs` | non-negative integer (ms), `0` disables | `180000` | Hard ceiling on total duration of a single summarizer stream call. Backstop for a stream that dribbles forever without going idle. Generous by design (clears the observed p99). `0` = no ceiling. |
| `summarizerConcurrency` | non-negative integer, `0` = unbounded | `4` | Max summarizer LLM calls in flight during one flush fan-out. A budget auto-flush drains the whole backlog at once, so an unbounded burst of N calls can trip provider rate limits (observed: 34 simultaneous calls answered with HTTP 429) and flip the configured summarizer into session-model fallback. Bounding the width - plus in-place rate-limit retry with a shared backoff gate - keeps the flush on the configured model. `0` restores the pre-pacing unbounded behavior for high-quota providers. |
| `protectedTools` | `string[]` | `[]` | Never-pruned tool names (e.g. `["todowrite","todoread"]`). When a protected tool's chain is range-compressed, its output is preserved verbatim inside the `<compressed-chain>` block as `<protected-output>` - protected outputs are never lost. |
| `protectedPaths` | `string[]` | `["**/skills/**/*.md"]` | Globs matched against a tool call's `args.path`; matching outputs are never pruned (same semantics as `protectedTools`, including `<protected-output>` relocation in compressed chains). Already-summarized matching reads are repaired on the next turn; chain-compressed ones are not. Set `[]` to disable. |
| `dedupByContentHash` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Re-reads of identical (toolName, content) skip the LLM and alias the original |
| `autoBudgetThreshold` | fraction `0`-`1`, or `null` | `null` | Token-budget auto-flush: force a prune when context usage reaches this share of the window, or 300k tokens, whichever comes first - regardless of `pruneOn`. `0.8` = 80%, not `80`. The 300k ceiling only binds on models advertising more than 300k. `null` = off. See [Token-budget auto-flush](#token-budget-auto-flush) |
| `spillThreshold` | positive integer | `65536` | Minimum chars (`resultText.length`) for a single tool result to be spilled eagerly to a sidecar file at capture time rather than waiting for normal summarization. Non-positive / invalid values fall back to the default; to effectively disable spilling, set it above any result you expect. See [Spilled outputs](#spilled-outputs) |
| `spillPreviewBytes` | non-negative integer | `2048` | Head preview (bytes) kept inline in the stub and index record for a spilled result. Full body is on disk. |
| `budgetTurnDelta` | fraction `0`-`1`, or `null` | `null` | Force a flush when a single turn's context-usage fraction jumps by at least this amount, ORed with `autoBudgetThreshold`. The fraction is measured against `min(context window, 300k)`, so `0.1` = +30k tokens in one turn on any model at or above 300k (+20k on a 200k model). Catches sudden spikes a static threshold would miss until the next turn. `null` = off. |
| `chainCompression.enabled` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Master toggle for chain-level range compression |
| `chainCompression.rollingWindow` | positive integer | `3` | Keep this many most-recent closed chains raw; compress older ones |
| `chainCompression.stripFinalAssistantThinking` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Strip thinking blocks from the kept final text-only assistant when compressing |
| `chainCompression.fuseRangeSummary` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Fuse a compressed chain's per-batch summaries into one cohesive LLM summary (one extra summarizer call per multi-batch span); off keeps the per-batch concatenation |
| `purgeErrors.enabled` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Replace failed toolCall argument bodies with compact stubs after cooldown |
| `purgeErrors.cooldownTurns` | positive integer | `2` | Turns to wait after a tool error before purging its argument body |
| `purgeErrors.minArgChars` | non-negative integer | `500` | Only purge arg bodies at least this many characters long |

See [PRUNING.md § Chain Compression](../PRUNING.md#chain-compression) and [PRUNING.md § Error Purge](../PRUNING.md#error-purge) for the full algorithms.

The three pre-flush features (`minBatchChars`, `protectedTools`, `dedupByContentHash`) are explained in [PRUNING.md § Pre-flush Pipeline & Safeguards](../PRUNING.md#pre-flush-pipeline--safeguards). They run BEFORE any summarizer LLM call and can each drop a batch outright while still advancing the prune frontier.

### Token-budget auto-flush

When `autoBudgetThreshold` is set to a value in `(0, 1]`, the extension checks context usage at the end of every tool-using turn. If `tokens` reaches `min(300_000, threshold * contextWindow)`, ALL pending batches are flushed immediately - regardless of `pruneOn` mode. This is an **additional** trigger layered on top of `pruneOn`, not a replacement.

- `0.8` means 80% of the context window - it is a **fraction**, not a percentage. `0.8 != 80`.
- **The trigger point is capped at 300,000 tokens** (`MAX_BUDGET_WINDOW` in `src/budget.ts`). Without it, an advertised 1M window makes every setting unreachable: `0.9` would mean 900k tokens, so a session ends before pruning ever fires. The ceiling never binds on a model advertising 300k or less - a 256k window at `0.9` still fires at 230.4k - so only huge-window models change behavior, and they flush earlier.
- `budgetTurnDelta` applies the same ceiling in the other shape: growth is measured against `min(context window, 300k)`, because a 300k ceiling on a single turn's *growth* could never bind.
- The trigger is a no-op when `tokens` is `null` (right after a provider-side compaction); it resumes once usage is known again.
- Editable live via `/pruner settings` (row "Auto-flush at context %", presets Off / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90%).
- Default `null` = off.

Inspired by DCP's `maxContextLimit` nudging; simplified to a single threshold that forces a flush rather than separate nudge/force levels.

### Spilled outputs

Single tool results larger than `spillThreshold` chars are written to `<session-dir>/<sessionId>-blobs/<key>.txt` at capture time and replaced in context with a short stub (tool name, byte size, head preview, file path). `<key>` is the sanitized occurrence key `id@resultTimestamp` (`@` becomes `_`, so `bash_23@1150` -> `bash_23_1150.txt`), not the bare `toolCallId` - keying on the bare id alone would let two occurrences of one reused provider id share a path and the second overwrite the first's blob. Recovery reads the `spillPath` persisted on the record rather than re-deriving it from the id, so a bare-id-named sidecar (no occurrence timestamp) still resolves. See [PRUNING.md § Occurrence Identity](../PRUNING.md#occurrence-identity). The full body is recoverable via the native `read` tool at the embedded path (offset/limit supported) or via `context_tree_query` by id, which falls back to the inline preview if the sidecar is missing. Moving a session `.jsonl` without its `-blobs/` directory loses only the giant-blob recovery path; bodies under `spillThreshold` stay inline in the index entry as usual.

### Choosing a summarizer model

The `default` setting reuses whatever model you have active in pi - convenient but wasteful, since summary writing doesn't need a top-tier coding model. Picking the smallest/fastest model on your plan saves both latency and cost.

If the configured summarizer model suffers a transient outage while your active pi model is healthy, pi-condense automatically falls back to the session model for the duration (with a one-time notice) and probes the configured model back every few minutes - no configuration needed.

| Plan | Suggested summarizer |
|---|---|
| OpenAI / Codex / Copilot | `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `xai/grok-3-fast` |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b` (cheap MoE) |
| Anthropic direct | `anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5` |
| Google AI direct | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` |

Set it from the slash command (saves immediately):

```bash
/pruner model openai/gpt-4.1-mini
/pruner thinking low
# or both in one go:
/pruner model openai/gpt-4.1-mini:low
```

### Summarizer timeouts

Every summarizer call is bounded by two independent timers, so a stalled
provider connection can never hang the agent turn:

- **Idle timeout** (`summarizerIdleTimeoutMs`, default 20s) - resets on every
  stream event, including reasoning/`thinking` events, so a long-but-flowing
  generation is never cut off. It also bounds time-to-first-token. This is
  the primary guard against a silent hang.
- **Total-duration ceiling** (`summarizerMaxTimeoutMs`, default 180s) - a hard
  upper bound that catches a stream which keeps dribbling events but never
  finishes. Generous by design; a pure backstop.

A timeout is treated exactly like a transient provider error: it feeds the
outage-fallback retry, so if a distinct `summarizerModel` is configured the
stalled call is retried once on the session model (itself timeout-bounded).
Both timers can be set to `0` to disable them independently.

### Flush pacing (concurrency + rate-limit retry)

A flush summarizes its whole backlog in one fan-out. `summarizerConcurrency`
(default `4`) bounds how many summarizer calls are in flight at once; queued
batches start as in-flight calls settle. Rate-limit-shaped failures (HTTP 429,
`resource has been exhausted`, quota/rate-limit/overloaded wording, server
retry-delay phrases) are retried **in place on the same model** with bounded
backoff (2 extra attempts, 2s base doubling, 30s per-wait cap - internal
constants, not user config), and a per-fan-out gate coordinates a shared
backoff window so the workers don't hammer the same quota wall during the
penalty (it coordinates rather than serializes — workers can wake together
when the window opens). Only when
those retries are exhausted does the failure classify as transient and feed
the outage fallback. Set `summarizerConcurrency: 0` for the old unbounded
burst.

## Tools surfaced to the LLM

**`context_tree_query`** - always available when the extension is loaded. Pruned summaries end with short refs like `Summarized tool refs: \`t1\`, \`t2\`. Use \`context_tree_query\` with these refs to retrieve the original full outputs.` The model passes those refs (or full `toolCallId`s) and gets back the original tool result text from the session index. Each per-tool bullet in the summary also carries its own inline `` `tN` `` ref, so recovering a specific tool is a single hop; the footer still lists every ref as a fallback. Content-hash-deduped duplicates resolve to the original's record automatically.

Short refs (`tN`) always resolve 1:1 and are the primary, recommended path; a reused `toolCallId` returns every matching occurrence instead of silently picking one, including occurrences deduplicated to an earlier record. See [PRUNING.md § Occurrence Identity](../PRUNING.md#occurrence-identity) for multi-occurrence recovery mechanics.

## Footer status widget

A footer widget shows the current state, controlled by `showPruneStatusLine`:

Every rendered state is prefixed with a single leading `|` divider so the segment stays visually isolated in the shared footer regardless of where other extensions' status segments land (load-order independent); there is no trailing divider - the footer's own space-join between segments already provides one.

- `| prune: OFF` - disabled
- `| prune: ON` - enabled, no flushes yet
- `| prune: ON . 92.0k->14.0k (-85%)` - enabled; live reclaim ratio (estimated tokens before->after, percent reduction). Updates on every `pruneMessages` call.
- `| prune: 3 pending` - batches queued, waiting for the trigger
- `| prune: summarizing...` - flush in progress
- `| prune: ON . 92.0k->14.0k (-85%) . diag u1/o2` - same as above, plus a self-hiding diagnostic segment (`u`/`m`/`o` counters, each hidden at zero). See [PRUNING.md § Diagnostics](../PRUNING.md#diagnostics).
- `| prune: ON . think 3.2k . gap 5.1k . chain 41%` - a context-pressure suffix, shown only when `frontierGapTokens > 0` (nothing to append when the frontier is fully caught up). All three are chars/4 token estimates, same convention as the reclaim ratio above:
  - `think` - `openCycleThinkingTokens`: thinking-block tokens trapped in the still-open cycle (after the last text-only assistant reply), not yet eligible for pruning.
  - `gap` - `frontierGapTokens`: summarization-eligible tool-result tokens sitting past the persisted prune frontier.
  - `chain` - `largestChainSharePct`: the largest single chain's (or the open segment's) share of total branch chars.
  See [PRUNING.md § Single-chain sessions](../PRUNING.md#single-chain-sessions) for exact definitions.
- `| prune: recovered pending (reload)` - shown at `agent_end` when a session reload found recoverable unflushed work but no new turn re-queued it. See [PRUNING.md § Reload rearm](../PRUNING.md#reload-rearm) for what "recovered" means and when it actually flushes.

Setting `showPruneStatusLine: false` hides the widget and silences the queued-turn notice; pruning still runs.

The status line does not show cost. Full token/cost detail is available via `/pruner stats`. The extension also emits cumulative session cost on the `cost:external` pi.events channel for external aggregators - see [README § External cost channel](../README.md#external-cost-channel).

### `/pruner status` context block

When context metrics are available, `/pruner status` appends a `--- context ---` block below the settings summary:

```
--- context ---
thinking:     3.2k tokens (open segment)
chain share:  41%
frontier gap: 5.1k tokens
rearmed:      yes
```

- `thinking` / `chain share` / `frontier gap` are the same `openCycleThinkingTokens` / `largestChainSharePct` / `frontierGapTokens` metrics shown in the footer suffix above, formatted as full labels here instead of a compact suffix.
- `rearmed: yes` appears only while the reload-rearm flag is armed (cleared the moment any flush attempt runs). See [PRUNING.md § Reload rearm](../PRUNING.md#reload-rearm).
