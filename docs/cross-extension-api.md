# Event API

The extension provides two cross-extension integration surfaces:

1. **Service accessor** (preferred) — a `Symbol.for()`-backed synchronous API on `globalThis` for direct policy queries.
2. **Event bus** — broadcasts on `pi.events` for observation.

---

## Service Accessor

The preferred way for other extensions to query the permission policy is the `Symbol.for()`-backed service accessor.
It provides direct, synchronous, type-safe function calls.

### Quick Start

```typescript
pi.events.on("permissions:ready", (data) => {
  const { sessionId } = data as PermissionsReadyEvent;
  if (!sessionId) return;
  void (async () => {
    try {
      const { getPermissionsService } =
        await import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system");
      const permissions = getPermissionsService(sessionId);
      if (permissions) {
        const result = permissions.checkPermission("bash", "git push");
        console.log(result.state); // "allow" | "deny" | "ask"
      }
    } catch {
      // Not installed — graceful degradation
    }
  })();
});
```

Inside your own `session_start` handler, `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionId()` is the same key.

### How It Works

Pi's extension loader creates a fresh [jiti](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/jiti) instance per extension with `moduleCache: false`, which isolates module-level state.
`Symbol.for()` and `globalThis` are process-global by spec, so they survive this isolation.

One process can host several **nodes** — one Pi session runtime each, with its own gates and its own registries.
A root session and each of its in-process subagent children are separate nodes, and each loads its own instance of this extension.
Registrations never cross a node boundary: a formatter, an access extractor, or an authorizer link is read by the node it was registered in.

Each node therefore publishes its own service at `session_start`, into a `globalThis` map keyed by that node's session id (`Symbol.for("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system:session-services")`).
Consumers call `getPermissionsService(sessionId)` to retrieve it — even though their `import()` loads a fresh module copy, the accessor reads from the shared `globalThis` slot.
The session id arrives as a field on the `permissions:ready` broadcast, which each node emits at its own `session_start`, right after publishing — and again at that node's first `before_agent_start`, so a consumer whose own `session_start` ran later still hears it.

That keyed map is the only service slot.
A separate legacy slot once held the process root's service, read by a deprecated `getRootPermissionsService()`; both were removed, because in any node but the root that accessor answered the wrong question — handing an in-process child the parent's service.
If you are upgrading from a release that had it, see [migration/0796-remove-process-root-slot.md](migration/0796-remove-process-root-slot.md); if you are upgrading from one whose `getPermissionsService()` took no argument, start with [migration/0794-keyed-service-locator.md](migration/0794-keyed-service-locator.md).

All types below are directly importable and type-check with `tsc` out of the box.
`@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`'s published `exports` resolve `import type { … }` to a self-contained, bundled declaration file with no internal module references, so a downstream `tsconfig.json` needs no special path configuration.

### API

The `PermissionsService` interface:

```typescript
interface PermissionsService {
  /** Query the permission policy for a surface and value. */
  checkPermission(
    surface: string,
    value?: string,
    agentName?: string,
  ): PermissionCheckResult;

  /** Query a surface's catch-all permission state — its blanket policy. */
  getToolPermission(toolName: string, agentName?: string): PermissionState;

  /** Whether every value under a tool's surface resolves to deny; use this to pre-filter a tool list. */
  isToolFullyDenied(toolName: string, agentName?: string): boolean;

  /**
   * Register a custom preview formatter for a specific tool name.
   * Returns a disposer that unregisters the formatter.
   * Throws if a formatter is already registered for that tool name.
   */
  registerToolInputFormatter(
    toolName: string,
    formatter: (input: Record<string, unknown>) => string | undefined,
  ): () => void;

  /**
   * Register a custom access-intent extractor for a specific tool name.
   * Declares the filesystem path a tool accesses so the `path` and
   * `external_directory` gates can see it. Returns a disposer; throws if an
   * extractor is already registered for that tool name.
   */
  registerToolAccessExtractor(
    toolName: string,
    extractor: (input: Record<string, unknown>) => string | undefined,
  ): () => void;

  /**
   * The access extractor registered on this node for `toolName`, or
   * `undefined` when it has none.
   */
  getToolAccessExtractor(
    toolName: string,
  ): ((input: Record<string, unknown>) => string | undefined) | undefined;

  /**
   * The preview formatter registered on this node for `toolName`, or
   * `undefined` when it has none.
   */
  getToolInputFormatter(
    toolName: string,
  ): ((input: Record<string, unknown>) => string | undefined) | undefined;
}
```

#### `checkPermission`

| Parameter   | Required | Description                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `surface`   | Yes      | Permission surface: `"bash"`, `"read"`, `"mcp"`, `"skill"`, `"external_directory"`, etc. |
| `value`     | No       | Value to evaluate (command, name, path); defaults to `""`                                |
| `agentName` | No       | Agent name for per-agent policy resolution                                               |

Returns `PermissionCheckResult` with fields `state`, `matchedPattern`, `source`, `origin`, etc.

For a path-shaped surface (`path`, `external_directory`, or a path-bearing tool — `read`/`write`/`edit`/`grep`/`find`/`ls`), the supplied `value` is matched against both the path as given and its canonical (symlink-resolved) form, at parity with the gates — so a query for a symlinked path matches a rule on its real target.

For the `bash` surface, a `value` containing a chained or nested command (joined by `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&`, or newlines, or nested in a command substitution/subshell) is decomposed into its command-pattern units and resolved most-restrictive (`deny` > `ask` > `allow`), at parity with the enforcement gate — so `cd /repo && npm install x` returns the decision of the `npm install x` unit, not the leading `cd`.
A previously chained command that returned `allow` (riding an allowed leading command) may therefore now return `deny`/`ask`.
Decomposition needs the tree-sitter parser, which is warmed at `before_agent_start` (before any tool call); a bash query in the brief pre-warm window falls back to a whole-string match, so the answer is never weaker than the gate — only strengthened once warm.

#### `getToolPermission`

Returns `"allow"` | `"deny"` | `"ask"` for a tool name without considering command-level rules.
It reports the surface's own catch-all, so it answers what a surface's blanket policy is.

```typescript
const blanketPolicy = permissions.getToolPermission("bash", agentName);
```

This is not the question to ask when pre-filtering a tool list — use `isToolFullyDenied` for that.
A surface written as `bash: {"*": "deny", "git *": "ask"}` reports `"deny"` here while `git status` would still be asked about.

#### `isToolFullyDenied`

Returns `true` when every value under the tool's surface resolves to `deny`, and `false` when anything at all could get through.
Use this to pre-filter a tool list before creating a child session — it avoids calling `checkPermission` per tool and interpreting the full result, and unlike `getToolPermission` it does not withhold a tool that is only partially restricted.

```typescript
const usable = tools.filter((t) => !permissions.isToolFullyDenied(t, agentName));
```

Rule ordering is honored (last-match-wins), so an exception written after a `deny` catch-all keeps the tool reachable while one written before it does not.
It considers config-layer rules only; a runtime session approval does not change the answer.

#### `registerToolInputFormatter`

Register a custom preview formatter for a specific tool name.
Permission ask-prompts call your formatter while building the prompt text, so you can show a human-readable summary of a tool call instead of the default truncated JSON.

```typescript
registerToolInputFormatter(
  toolName: string,
  formatter: (input: Record<string, unknown>) => string | undefined,
): () => void; // returns a disposer
```

Registration rules:

- One formatter per tool name.
  A second `register` for the same name throws — there is no silent override.
- The returned disposer unregisters the formatter.
  It is identity-guarded, so a stale disposer cannot evict a later registration of the same name.

##### Which tool name to key on

The `toolName` you register is matched against the **registered Pi tool name** the agent invoked — not against MCP server/tool pairs.

- For a tool your extension registers directly with Pi, use that tool's exact name (the same string Pi shows in `pi.getAllTools()`).
- For **MCP** calls, every server tool arrives as the single umbrella `"mcp"` tool, with the real target in `input.tool` (e.g. `"exa:search"`).
  You therefore cannot register a formatter per `server:tool`.
  The `"mcp"` name is already claimed by the built-in summarizer (below), and because duplicate registration throws, you cannot replace it.
  If you need richer per-server MCP previews, open an issue — that requires a chained-formatter model this seam does not yet provide.
- `"bash"` never reaches your formatter: bash prompts take a dedicated branch that shows the command directly.

##### What your formatter receives

The `input` argument is the raw tool-call input object exactly as the agent supplied it (the tool's arguments).
It is always a plain record; shapes by tool:

| Tool                   | `input` shape                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mcp` (umbrella)       | `{ tool: "server:tool", server?, arguments?: object, … }` — summarize `input.arguments` |
| `read`                 | `{ path, offset?, limit? }`                                                             |
| `write`                | `{ path, content }`                                                                     |
| `edit`                 | `{ path, edits?: […] }` or `{ path, oldText, newText }`                                 |
| `grep` / `find` / `ls` | `{ pattern?, glob?, path? }`                                                            |
| your own tool          | whatever input schema your tool registered                                              |

Treat every field as untrusted: the agent can emit malformed or partial input, so read defensively (type-check before use) rather than assuming a shape.

##### What your return value does

The returned string is spliced into the middle of the prompt sentence:

```text
Agent 'Explore' requested tool 'deploy' <your fragment>. Allow this call?
```

Return a short grammatical fragment that reads naturally in that slot — e.g. `"with target staging (3 services)"` or `"runs 2 commands"`, not a full sentence and not raw JSON.

Return semantics:

- Return a **string** to use it verbatim as the preview (this also overrides the built-in preview for built-in tools like `read`/`edit`).
- Return **`undefined`** to decline — the prompt falls through to the built-in formatter for that tool, and finally to the truncated-JSON default.
  Prefer `undefined` over `""` when you have nothing useful to add: an empty string short-circuits the fallthrough and suppresses the default preview entirely.

##### Your formatter must not throw

The core does **not** wrap your formatter in a `try/catch`.
A thrown error propagates into prompt construction and can break the permission prompt — a denial-of-service on the gate.
Guard your own parsing and return `undefined` on anything unexpected.

##### End-to-end wiring

Register during your extension's initialization and store the disposer for teardown:

```typescript
export default function myExtension(pi: ExtensionAPI): void {
  let disposeFormatter: (() => void) | undefined;

  pi.events.on("permissions:ready", (data) => {
    const { sessionId } = data as PermissionsReadyEvent;
    if (disposeFormatter || !sessionId) return;
    void (async () => {
      try {
        const { getPermissionsService } =
          await import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system");
        const permissions = getPermissionsService(sessionId);
        disposeFormatter = permissions?.registerToolInputFormatter(
          "deploy", // a tool THIS extension registers with Pi
          (input) => {
            const target =
              typeof input.target === "string" ? input.target : undefined;
            const services = Array.isArray(input.services)
              ? input.services.length
              : undefined;
            if (!target) return undefined; // decline → default preview
            return services !== undefined
              ? `with target ${target} (${services} services)`
              : `with target ${target}`;
          },
        );
      } catch {
        // permission-system not installed — nothing to register
      }
    })();
  });

  pi.on("session_shutdown", () => {
    disposeFormatter?.();
    disposeFormatter = undefined;
  });
}
```

Reload note: on `/reload`, the permission-system publishes a fresh service backed by a new registry, so previous registrations are dropped.
Re-register on every initialization (as above) rather than once globally; the disposer is for explicit teardown within a single load.

##### Recommended practices

- Keep previews short — they appear inline in a yes/no prompt, and the result is truncated by the configured preview length anyway.
- Never surface secrets (tokens, keys, full request bodies) in a preview; summarize counts and identifiers instead.
- Parse defensively and return `undefined` on malformed input — never throw.
- Return a grammatical fragment, not raw JSON or a full sentence.
- Register idempotently on each extension load; dispose on `session_shutdown`.

##### Built-in MCP summarizer

A built-in formatter is registered for the `"mcp"` tool at startup (through this same public API).
It renders a compact `with key: value, …` summary of the call's `arguments` and returns `undefined` when there are no arguments, leaving the MCP target prompt unchanged.
This is the reference implementation for the seam — see `src/tool-input/builtin-tool-input-formatters.ts`.

#### `registerToolAccessExtractor`

Declare the filesystem path a tool will access so the cross-cutting `path` and `external_directory` gates can evaluate it.

```typescript
registerToolAccessExtractor(
  toolName: string,
  extractor: (input: Record<string, unknown>) => string | undefined,
): () => void; // returns a disposer
```

You usually do **not** need this.
Path gating is on by default for every tool whose input follows the convention:

- Built-in file tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `find`, `grep`, `ls`) and any tool exposing `input.path` are extracted automatically.
- MCP calls are extracted from `input.arguments.path`.
- `bash` is never extracted here — it has its own token-based path gates.

Register an extractor only when a tool carries its path under a **non-standard key** (e.g. `input.target` or `input.file`).
Return the path string, or `undefined` to decline.

```typescript
const dispose = permissions.registerToolAccessExtractor("ffgrep", (input) =>
  typeof input.target === "string" ? input.target : undefined,
);
```

Registration rules mirror `registerToolInputFormatter`: one extractor per tool name (a second `register` for the same name throws), and the returned disposer is identity-guarded.
The extractor must not throw — guard your parsing and return `undefined` on anything unexpected.

#### `getToolAccessExtractor` and `getToolInputFormatter`

Read back what a node has registered for a tool.

```typescript
getToolAccessExtractor(toolName: string): ToolAccessExtractor | undefined;
getToolInputFormatter(toolName: string): ToolInputFormatter | undefined;
```

These are the read face of the two **fact-shaping** registries, and unlike every other surface here they are meant to be read across a node boundary.
An extractor produces a fact about a call (the path it touches) and a formatter produces display text; neither decides anything, so a node whose own registry has no entry may resolve an ancestor's service and use its answer.
The permission system does exactly that internally: a subagent child that is missing an extractor for a tool falls back to its ancestors in the same process, so excluding an extractor's provider from child sessions cannot leave that tool's path invisible to the child's gates ([ADR 0012] decision 1, the fact-shaping clause).

There is deliberately **no** equivalent reader for `registerAuthorizer`.
A chain link returns a verdict, and live authority converges at the adjudicating node ([ADR 0007] §7) — inheriting one would run authority an operator's own extension exclusion removed.

#### Subagent session registration

Subagent registration is announcement-driven, and the spawner makes no service call.
The channel names, payload shapes, pre-bind ordering, and the out-of-process environment variable are specified by the subagent adapter convention in [Subagent Integration](subagent-integration.md#the-subagent-adapter-convention).

### Reload Safety

During `/reload`, all extensions re-initialize.
The permission-system re-publishes a fresh service at `session_start`; teardown is identity-scoped for both slots, so a superseded generation's shutdown only removes an entry it still owns and cannot wipe the new service.
Consumers that re-initialize during reload naturally get the new instance.

Best practice: resolve the service per use rather than caching the reference.

### Graceful Degradation

`getPermissionsService(sessionId)` returns `undefined` when the permission-system extension has not loaded into that node (or has been unloaded).
The `import()` throws if the package is not installed.
Wrap both in `try/catch` + `if` guard as shown in the Quick Start example.

It also returns `undefined` when called with no session id at all — a shape TypeScript rejects but JavaScript reaches — rather than guessing a node, since answering with another node's service is the defect the keyed locator exists to prevent.
That call emits a once-guarded Node warning (code `PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_WARN0001`), because the guard above turns the missing service into a registration that silently never happens.
It is deliberately not a `DeprecationWarning`: `--no-deprecation` does not silence it.

---

## Event Bus

The extension also emits events on Pi's `pi.events` bus so other extensions can observe permission decisions and integrate with the policy system without importing this package.

## Stability Guarantee

Fields may be added to any payload, but existing fields will not be removed or renamed without a semver-major version bump.
The broadcast contract is defined by the published TypeScript types plus package semver — broadcast payloads (`permissions:ready`, `permissions:ui_prompt`, `permissions:decision`) carry no `protocolVersion`.
Consumers should read broadcast payloads defensively (field-presence checks) rather than version-gating — that is robust to any shape skew between independently-versioned sibling extensions.

All three broadcasts are best-effort: a throwing listener cannot block permission handling, session startup, or gate resolution.

## Channel Reference

| Channel                 | Direction | When                                                                                                  | Payload type              |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `permissions:ready`     | Broadcast | At each node's `session_start` after that node publishes, and again at its first `before_agent_start` | `PermissionsReadyEvent`   |
| `permissions:ui_prompt` | Broadcast | Before active UI prompt                                                                               | `PermissionUiPromptEvent` |
| `permissions:decision`  | Broadcast | After every gate resolution                                                                           | `PermissionDecisionEvent` |

---

## UI Prompt Broadcasts

The permission system emits `permissions:ui_prompt` immediately before it invokes the active user-facing permission UI.
This event is for integrations such as notification extensions that should alert only when the user needs to respond to a permission prompt.
It is not a generic "permission request entered waiting state" event, and it does not imply the prompt will be approved.
Policy decisions that resolve without an active UI prompt, such as `policy_allow`, `policy_deny`, `session_approved`, `infrastructure_auto_allowed`, or `auto_approved`, do not emit this event.
Non-UI child sessions also do not emit this event when they create a forwarded permission request; the parent UI session emits it immediately before showing the forwarded permission dialog.
A forwarded request the parent's own recorded policy decides (a matching `allow` or `deny`) is answered without a prompt and emits no event; the event fires only when the parent is actually about to ask the human.
The matching terminal `permissions:decision` is emitted in the parent session too, so a consumer that reacts to this event has a signal on the same bus telling it the prompt is over.
Forwarded prompts that do reach the human are not degraded: the parent emits the child's original `source` and the same `surface`/`value` display projection, plus a populated `forwarding` context identifying the requesting subagent.

The payload is lean by design — `surface`/`value` are the normalized display projection a notification consumer reads, not a mirror of the internal review log.
Read defensively rather than version-gating: broadcast payloads carry no `protocolVersion`.

The event carries no assembled sentence.
It carries `request`, the permission ask's invariant core, verbatim from the prompt payload — no evidence and no annotations.
The bus is the narrowest renderer: any loaded extension can observe it without the operator having named that extension, whereas every other route to an ask's evidence requires that consent (a registered tool-input formatter, or an `Authorizer` link the operator lists in `authorizerChain`).

```typescript
import type { PermissionUiPromptEvent } from "@gotgenes/pi-permission-system";

pi.events.on("permissions:ui_prompt", (raw) => {
  const event = raw as PermissionUiPromptEvent;
  // Defensive read: tolerate any shape skew between sibling extensions.
  if (typeof event.value !== "string") {
    return;
  }
  notify(event.surface, event.value, event.request.matchedPattern);
  // e.g. "bash" "git push" "git *"
});
```

### Payload Fields

| Field        | Type                             | Description                                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requestId`  | `string`                         | Id of the permission request being prompted, minted when it was created |
| `source`     | `PermissionUiPromptSource`       | Prompt origin: `"tool_call"`, `"skill_input"`, or `"skill_read"`        |
| `surface`    | `string \| null`                 | Normalized display surface (e.g. `"bash"`, `"skill"`), when known       |
| `value`      | `string \| null`                 | Normalized display value (command, path, skill name, etc.), when known  |
| `agentName`  | `string \| null`                 | Active/requesting agent name, when known                                |
| `request`    | `PromptRequestFacts`             | The ask's invariant core — no evidence, no annotations                  |
| `forwarding` | `ForwardedPromptContext \| null` | Forwarding context, or `null` for a direct prompt                       |

Forwarding is orthogonal to origin: a forwarded subagent prompt keeps its original `source` and is identified by a non-null `forwarding` field, not by a dedicated source value.

#### `PromptRequestFacts`

The facts every render of the ask shows, that no renderer's budget may elide.
Nested rather than flattened so the event and the prompt payload share one shape: a fact added here reaches the bus without a second hand-maintained declaration.

| Field             | Type                         | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `requester`       | `PromptRequester`            | Who is asking, and whether the ask arrived from a subagent                                       |
| `surface`         | `string`                     | The **gate** surface the rule fired on — `"external_directory"`, `"path"`, `"bash"`, a tool name |
| `toolName`        | `string \| null`             | The gated tool name; `null` when the ask is not tool-shaped                                      |
| `invokedToolName` | `string \| null`             | The invoked name when a shell alias re-exposes bash under another name                           |
| `value`           | `string`                     | The decision-relevant value: the command, path, MCP target, or skill name                        |
| `matchedPattern`  | `string \| null`             | The matched rule, including a sentinel such as `<indirection-bash-wrapper>`                      |
| `commandContext`  | `BashCommandContext \| null` | Where the offending bash unit runs, when it came from a substitution or subshell                 |
| `executedUnit`    | `string \| null`             | For bash, the unit that will actually run, including inside an unstrippable wrapper              |

`PromptRequester` carries `agentName` (`string | null`), `forwarded` (`boolean`), and `sessionId` (`string | null`, the requesting session for a forwarded ask).

The top-level `surface` and `request.surface` are two different facts and both belong on the event.
The top-level one is the **display** projection — the child's tool name, what a notification shows.
`request.surface` is the **gate** surface the rule fired on: a `read` of a path outside the working directory displays as `"read"` and gates on `"external_directory"`.

#### `ForwardedPromptContext`

Present only when the prompt was forwarded from a non-UI subagent.

| Field                | Type             | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `requesterAgentName` | `string \| null` | Requesting subagent's display name, when known |
| `requesterSessionId` | `string \| null` | Requesting subagent's session id, when known   |

The `surface`/`value` pair is a deliberate display projection that replaces the redundant per-source fields (`command`/`path`/`target`/`skillName`/`toolName`/`toolCallId`/`toolInputPreview`/`sessionLabel`) from earlier drafts — none of which the notification use case reads.
The stability guarantee is additive, so any can be reintroduced in a later minor when a concrete consumer needs them.

## Decision Broadcasts

Every permission gate resolution emits a `permissions:decision` event, regardless of outcome.
This is useful for dashboards, telemetry, or audit overlays.

A session serving another session's forwarded request emits one too, on its own bus, for every forwarded ask it escalates.
That is what makes a forwarded prompt clearable: the ask is gated in the requesting session — a different process for an out-of-process subagent — so without it the serving session broadcasts a `permissions:ui_prompt` whose outcome never appears.
A forwarded request the serving session's own policy allows or denies is answered without a prompt and broadcasts nothing, matching the UI-prompt channel.
A served decision carries a non-null `forwarding` context; the requesting session still emits its own decision when the answer comes back.
That requesting-side decision is attributed to whatever decided **inside** the responding session: a rule there reports `policy_allow` / `policy_deny`, a chain link reports `authorizer_allowed` / `authorizer_denied`, and a human there reports `user_approved` / `user_denied`.
The `resolution` names what decided, never where.

The `requestId` is the same id the request's review-log entries carry, and the same one `permissions:ui_prompt` carried if the request reached a prompt — so a prompt and its outcome are joinable, as are two concurrent prompts for the same command.
A request that reaches a prompt is answered by exactly one terminal event on that prompt's own bus, including when the dialog itself fails.
It identifies a permission _request_, not a tool call: one tool call runs several gates and so raises several requests, each with its own id.
Use the review log's `toolCallId` to join back to the Pi transcript.

```typescript
pi.events.on("permissions:decision", (raw) => {
  const event =
    raw as import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system").PermissionDecisionEvent;
  console.log(event.surface, event.result, event.resolution);
  // e.g. "bash" "allow" "user_approved_for_session"
});
```

## Ready Event

Each node emits `permissions:ready` at its own `session_start`, right after publishing its service — so a consumer reacting to it can immediately resolve that node's service.
It emits again at that node's first `before_agent_start`, which runs after every extension's `session_start` and before any tool call, hence before any permission prompt.

So the channel's contract is: **fires at least once per session, and may repeat.**
A handler must be idempotent.
That guarantee is what makes the ready event alone a sufficient registration site: a consumer that needs its own config before it can register no longer has to attempt registration from `session_start` as well, hoping one of the two orderings completes the pair.
A new session generation (`/reload`, `/new`, `/resume`) starts the cycle over: one emission at `session_start`, one at the first turn that follows.

Guard your registration on the disposer you stored, as the example below does.
An unguarded handler that calls `registerAuthorizer`, `registerToolInputFormatter`, or `registerToolAccessExtractor` on every emission hits the duplicate-registration throw on the second one.
That throw is caught by Pi's event bus and reported on stderr — your first registration stays live — but the noise is avoidable, and it was already reachable before the latch existed, since `/reload` re-runs `session_start`.

The payload carries plain facts about the node that emitted it, never a live capability: the bus announces, the locator provides.
It carries no `protocolVersion` — the broadcast contract is defined by the published types plus package semver.

| Field                | Type             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessionId`          | `string \| null` | The emitting node's session id — the key for `getPermissionsService`. `null` when the host exposed no session id, in which case that node published no keyed service. |
| `adjudicatesLocally` | `boolean`        | Whether this node's authorizer chain runs, or the node relays its asks to a serving node that runs _its_ chain over the same facts.                                   |

```typescript
let dispose: (() => void) | undefined;

pi.events.on("permissions:ready", (data) => {
  const { sessionId } = data as PermissionsReadyEvent;
  // Idempotent: ready may repeat, so a second emission must be a no-op.
  if (dispose || !sessionId) return;
  void (async () => {
    const { getPermissionsService } =
      await import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system");
    const permissions = getPermissionsService(sessionId);
    // This node published before the event fired — resolve and register now.
    dispose = permissions?.registerAuthorizer("my-link", authorize);
  })();
});

pi.on("session_shutdown", () => {
  dispose?.();
  dispose = undefined;
});
```

A registration needs no branch on `adjudicatesLocally`.
Formatters and access extractors are read by every node's own gates, and a chain link registered on a relaying node is accepted (its disposer works) and recorded in the review log as `authorizer_link_vacant` rather than refused — so registering everywhere is the correct default.
Registering on _every_ node also stays the best practice for a formatter or extractor provider: the ancestor fallback is a repair for a node that could not register, not a reason to register in one place on purpose.
