# Retro: pi-permission-system — Phase 15 Planning (token-roles-declared-effects-sandbox-seam)

## Stage: Improvement Planning (2026-09-05T16:10:59Z)

### Session summary

The cause hypothesis read ADR 0013 §10's recursive verdict fold against the two flat projections `BashProgram.parse` runs and predicted a "walker fusion" phase; the craftsmanship scout refuted the fusion reading (the generic and pattern-first walkers, and `readCommandWords` versus `commandArgumentWords`, differ in filter and output), and the corrected cause is narrower: a token's role is established at collection and discarded before projection, which is [#609] and [#863] seen from opposite sides.
A second cause surfaced from measurement rather than reading — the gates' blame facts ride a `logContext` the ask path never writes, so zero review-log entries carry an `effect` key and 134 bash `external_directory` asks record `path: null`.
The phase shape is full: six steps over three tracks, adopting ADR 0013 staging slices 4–6 and filing the unfiled remainder of slice 2 ([#880]) plus the blame defect ([#881]); [#804] and the three ADR deliberations defer to Phase 16.

### Observations

- **The operator's mid-analysis worry reshaped the phase, and measuring it was what made that safe.**
  "The false-positive asks frustrate me but I don't know how to fix them" could have produced a classifier-rewrite phase.
  Scanning the local review log instead showed non-path tokens at 4.5% of `external_directory` asks and trending to zero, revision ranges at zero, and 95% of the friction being real paths where direction is the question — which put [#863] and [#859] in as two small `fix:` steps and made `commandEffects` the priority-20 spine.
  The scan script is committed (`scripts/measure-path-false-positives.mjs`, wired as `measure:path-false-positives`) so the number can be re-run rather than argued with.
- **Measurement found a defect the doc, the skill, and an ADR all describe as working.**
  The package skill says each bash gate stamps `effect`/`effectSource` on its `logContext` "so `{ effect: "unproven", effectSource: "retracted" }` reads as …"; the mechanism is real and the sentence is false for every ask, because `PermissionPrompter` renders from `PromptPermissionDetails`.
  A claim about what a log carries is verifiable by `grep -c` on the log; do that before citing it.
- **The declared candidate lived in four places, and one of them was unfiled.**
  Phase 14's history named slices 4–7; ADR 0013's Staging section named them too; the Phase-handoff sweep hit [#837]'s retro; and `commandEffects` — half of slice 2 — was in none of the trackers, only in a `docs/configuration.md` sentence describing it as shipped.
  A staging list in an ADR is a declared-candidate carrier of the same standing as a history file's Findings; sweep its `landed` markers, not just its numbering.
- **[#800] closed as completed without a code change.**
  Its ask was delivered by [#806]/[#807] under a different mechanism (a `_read` surface rather than a whitelist bypass); the close comment states where the body's constraints hold and where the shipped design differs (the read-path source).
  An issue filed before a phase can be satisfied by that phase's design without any step naming it — check the delivered mechanism against the ask, not the ask's proposed mechanism.
- **Feasibility probes that mattered:** `nono run --read/--write/--allow -- <cmd>` exists (Landlock/Seatbelt), so Step 6's outcome is deliverable, with the root-derivation design question recorded on the step; `getComposedConfigRules` is reachable from `index.ts`, so the service can derive the scope; the `script` role in `PATTERN_FIRST_COMMANDS` already exists, so [#863] needs table entries rather than a new mechanism; `shellTools`'s shallow merge is the precedent [#880] copies.
- **Deferral-gate and trajectory:** cause-level findings existed (Category A and C), so the gate did not fire; max priority 20 for the fourth consecutive phase, so no cadence question.
  Repeat deferrals were put to the operator explicitly — [#620] at its 4th sweep, [#751] at its 3rd, [#822] behind the sandbox seam — and each carries its ordinal in the dispositions.
- **Fallow's duplication figure moved from 0.1% to 1.3% with no production change**: five `scripts/measure-*.mjs` instruments clone one review-log prelude.
  The metric row now counts `src/` clone groups only; the prelude extraction rides whichever step next adds an instrument (this planning added a sixth without extracting, deliberately keeping the planning commit to the roadmap).

## Stage: Improvement Planning — amendment (2026-09-05T16:30:46Z)

### Session summary

After the roadmap was committed, the operator clarified that the friction is the **false positive** (a token that is not a path) and not the ask about a real external file, with [#797]'s spreadsheet cell reference as the example.
That split the shape-indistinguishable class across two complementary levers and added a seventh step: [#797] became Step 4's named acceptance case (`commandEffects: { officecli: { effects: [] } }` withdraws a declared tool's operands), and the ADR 0007 §5 deliberation — may a chain link dismiss an `external_directory` ask for a token naming nothing on disk — was pulled in from the deferred design budget as Step 7 ([#882]).

### Observations

- **The first composition gate collapsed two populations the operator keeps apart.**
  "False-positive asks" was read as one bucket, measured as 4.5% and trending to zero, and the phase was composed around the 95% of real external paths.
  The operator's clarification separated a *nonexistent* path from a *real* one, and the measurement had already shown the second was fine — the residual that mattered was the shape-indistinguishable token, which the scan could not see because it is shaped exactly like a path.
  When the operator names a specific example ([#797]), trace that example through the levers before the gate, not after it: the answer — no deterministic rule can separate `/Sheet1/B1` from `/etc/passwd` — is what made the two-lever framing obvious.
- **A deferred design deliberation was the missing lever, not a code step.**
  Track C was deferred wholesale as "ADR budget", but one of its three items (the §5/§7 contradiction) was load-bearing for the operator's stated goal and the other two were not.
  Defer design work item by item against the phase's cause, never as a category.
- **`effects: []` was in ADR 0013 §7's text and in [#880]'s first body, and its enforcement meaning was stated in neither.**
  "No filesystem effect" implies "no surface to consult" implies "operands withdrawn", but the chain of implication was only written down once the acceptance case forced it.
  A config value's semantics are the test it must pass; name the test in the issue.
- **Both levers are the same ADR 0013 §7 layering applied to candidacy rather than effect**: a declared fact at zero tokens on the ask-producing side, judgment on the ask-consuming side for what nobody declared.
  The framing that dissolved the "complementary or redundant?"
  question was naming which side of `evaluate()` each lever sits on.
- **Steps are numbered in landing order, at the operator's request.**
  The first draft numbered the spine first ([#609] as Step 1) and the small fixes that precede it as Steps 2 and 3, then told the reader to land them 2 → 3 → 1.
  A roadmap's numbering is its sequence; when the tracks section has to say "land 2 before 1", renumber the steps rather than annotate them.

## Stage: Re-sequencing — sandbox first (2026-09-07T04:18:01Z)

### Session summary

During [#863]'s planning session the operator asked whether the projection is in diminishing returns, and the answer — measured on macOS and in a Docker Linux container — reshaped the phase: [#892] (the sandbox ADR) folds into Step 6, which moves first and is scoped up; Steps 1–5 and 7 wait on the record.
The full account, measurements, and the `#### Phase handoff` note live in `0863-interpreter-inline-script-role.md`; this entry exists so the phase's own record says where its spine moved and why.

### Observations

- The phase's cause statement ("a bash token's role is established at collection and discarded before projection") is still true; what changed is whether closing it is worth a phase.
  Under the record, the projection becomes a hint for the fallback prompt and the Windows layer, so a role thread that makes it see *more* is polishing a demoted layer.
- Step 6's Track C is no longer disjoint from the others by *files* only; it is prior to them by *decision*.
  `/finish-phase` should reconcile Steps 1–5 and 7 against the record's dispositions in [#892] rather than against their original `Outcome:` lines.
- Two upstream dependencies were filed with instrumented evidence: nolabs-ai/nono#1796 (macOS denial reporting below the direct child) and nolabs-ai/nono#1797 (Linux elevation does not trap creation).
