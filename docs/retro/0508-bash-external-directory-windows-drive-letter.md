# Retro: #508 — fix: bash external_directory gate misses Windows drive-letter absolute paths

## Stage: Planning (2026-06-27T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned the fix for the bash `external_directory` gate missing Windows drive-letter absolute paths (`C:/…` and `C:\…`).
The operator's questions drove the scope progressively deeper: from "which classifier(s)" → "detect the platform?"
→ "what makes this change easy (Kent Beck)?"
→ "is there an architectural root cause?".
The investigation surfaced that the package has a half-threaded, ambient platform dependency (`process.platform` and the host-bound `node:path` import read in ~6 interior modules), which is the real root cause behind the recurring Windows-path bugs.
Filed that as a separate architecture issue, #510, and rebased #508's plan to land on #510's clean seam.

### Observations

- **Scope decisions (via `ask_user`).**
  Confirmed: recognize both separator forms in *both* classifiers (not just the strict one); detect drive paths by a drive-letter prefix regex (`/^[a-zA-Z]:[/\\]/`), not "any backslash"; keep gating drive-shaped tokens on POSIX (do not warn/drop — dropping would *reduce* POSIX `path`-surface coverage of the real in-CWD `./C:/foo` access).
- **No `process.platform` branch.**
  The platform-sensitive decision ("is `C:/foo` absolute?") already lives in `node:path` (`path.win32` vs `path.posix`).
  Shape recognition is platform-independent string matching; absoluteness delegates to the injected flavor.
  This satisfies the package's own `code-design` rule against reading `process.platform` in utility functions.
- **Architectural root cause → #510.**
  `path-utils.ts` `isPathWithinDirectory` and `rule.ts` already use an injectable `platform: NodeJS.Platform = process.platform` parameter (with the testability rationale in the doc comment), but the seam was never threaded end-to-end: `normalizePathForComparison` hard-codes `process.platform` inline, `canonicalizePath` / `AccessPath.forPath` take no flavor, and `cwd-projection.ts` imports host-bound `node:path` and hand-rolls `startsWith("/")`.
  Threading an injected `PathSemantics`/platform flavor through the pipeline is the structural correction that makes #382/#345/#418/#508 and future Windows forms (UNC, `\\?\`, drive-relative) a single-home change.
- **Sequencing (operator choice).**
  Refactor first (#510), then rebase #508 onto the clean seam.
  On that seam #508 collapses to: add the drive-letter shape to the classifiers; the `isRelativeCandidate` → injected `isAbsolute` conversion and the win32 testability both belong to #510 (no `vi.mock("node:path")`).
- **Tidy-first insight.**
  The naive classifier-only fix would briefly over-flag an inside-CWD drive path under an unknown `cd` base (a Windows-absolute path mislabeled "relative" by the hand-rolled check). #510's `isAbsolute` delegation eliminates that window, so #508 needs no transient cleanup.
- **`#509`** is the sibling issue (bare-filename `path`-surface bypass) split from the same parent #494 — explicitly out of scope here.

## Stage: Planning refresh — post-#510/#511 (2026-06-28T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

## 510 and #511 are closed; the platform/path-semantics seam landed as `PathNormalizer` (`src/path-normalizer.ts`), and the old `cwd-projection.ts` is now the class-based `bash-path-resolver.ts` holding `this.normalizer`

Refreshed the #508 plan from its abstract "injected flavor" wording to the concrete API and confirmed the scope reduction the plan anticipated.

### Observations

- **#510 deferred the `isRelativeCandidate` conversion**, exactly the contingency the original plan flagged. `foldCd` already delegates to `this.normalizer.isAbsolute`, but the module-level free function `isRelativeCandidate` (`bash-path-resolver.ts`, two call sites: `projectExternalPaths`, `buildRuleCandidatePath`) still hand-rolls `!startsWith("/") && !startsWith("~")`. #508 folds in converting it to a private method delegating to `this.normalizer.isAbsolute` — load-bearing, since the projection's relative/unknown decision (not just `foldCd`) gates the over-flag.
- **Testability is clean as predicted.** `BashProgram.parse(command, normalizer)` and `extractExternalPathsFromBashCommand(command, normalizer)` take a `PathNormalizer`; `bash-external-directory.test.ts` already builds `new PathNormalizer(process.platform, cwd)`. #508's Windows assertions construct `new PathNormalizer("win32", cwd)` — no `vi.mock("node:path")`.
- **#508 now reduces to two production edits + docs**: drive-shape recognition in both classifiers (`token-classification.ts`, unchanged by #510) and the `isRelativeCandidate` conversion (`bash-path-resolver.ts`).
  Single `fix:` commit + `docs:` commit.
- Next step: `/tdd-plan`.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-06-28T20:15:00Z)

### Session summary

Completed 2 TDD cycles in a single session: (1) the core `fix:` commit adding `WINDOWS_DRIVE_PATH_PATTERN` to both classifiers and converting `isRelativeCandidate` to a private method delegating to `this.normalizer.isAbsolute`; (2) the `docs:` commit updating `architecture.md` and `SKILL.md`.
Test count went from 2195 to 2211 (+16 tests: 8 new classifier unit tests and 4 new win32 end-to-end assertions across 2 test files).
Pre-completion reviewer returned **PASS**.

### Observations

- **`isRelativeCandidate` edit required three partial attempts** due to the decorator rule line (`──`) in `bash-path-resolver.ts` — the Unicode box-drawing characters miscount when anchoring `oldText`, causing atomic batch rejections.
  Resolved by anchoring on adjacent unique code lines rather than the rule itself (as AGENTS.md warns), and by splitting the class-closing brace into a separate edit from the rule line.
- **The unknown-base win32 test passed green before the implementation** (tokens were dropped → empty result), so it was not a red test in the strict sense.
  After the fix it stays green for the correct reason (inside-CWD check fires).
  This is expected for the "over-flag prevention" path — the red test for the over-flag scenario would require a Windows absolute path that is *outside* CWD under an unknown base, but the plan test chose inside-CWD to exercise the conversion specifically.
  No deviation: the test does cover the `isRelativeCandidate` routing change as documented in the test comment.
- **`c://x` URL rejection confirmed**: the `URL_PATTERN` (`/^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*:\/\//i`) fires before the drive pattern for single-letter schemes with `//`, so there is no ambiguity between the URL guard and the new drive pattern.
- **Pre-completion reviewer verdict**: PASS.
  All deterministic checks, invariants, and doc surfaces clean.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-06-29T01:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Shipped #508 cleanly: pushed the two commits, CI green, closed the issue, and merged release-please PR #514 to cut `pi-permission-system-v17.1.1`.
This closes a four-stage arc (Planning → Planning refresh → TDD → Ship) in which operator-driven Socratic questioning during planning turned a one-line hand-rolled fix into a clean fix layered on a properly-threaded `PathNormalizer` seam (#510), with #511 as a follow-up.

### Observations

#### What went well

- **Operator-driven architectural depth (planning).**
  The progressive questioning — "which classifier?"
  → "detect the platform?"
  → "what makes this change easy?"
  → "is there an architectural root cause?"
  — surfaced the half-threaded ambient-platform dependency and produced #510 / #511.
  Without it, #508 would have shipped a hand-rolled `startsWith("/")` check that drifts from `node:path` and a fragile `vi.mock("node:path")` test.
  Strategic judgment applied at exactly the right moment.
- **Plan contingency foresight paid off.**
  The original plan flagged "if #510 defers the `isRelativeCandidate` conversion, fold it into #508." #510 did defer it; the Planning-refresh stage confirmed the contingency and folded it in with zero rework.
- **Ship-flow `IN_PROGRESS`-check handling worked as designed.**
  Release-please PR #514 returned `UNSTABLE` with a CI check still `IN_PROGRESS`.
  The session polled `statusCheckRollup` until `SUCCESS` and then merged via `release_pr_merge`, rather than falling back to `gh pr merge` while a check was running — exactly the `/ship-issue` step-6.4 refinement.
  The refined instruction prevented a premature merge.
- **Clean TDD execution.**
  Two cycles, +16 tests, pre-completion PASS, no follow-up fixups.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `other` — the `isRelativeCandidate` edit needed three attempts because `oldText` spanned the `──` decorator rule line in `bash-path-resolver.ts`; the Unicode box-drawing run miscounts and rejected the atomic batch.
  Impact: two extra `Edit` calls, no rework — resolved by anchoring on adjacent code lines, which is exactly what AGENTS.md already prescribes.
  The rule exists and is crisp; this was a first-attempt-application slip, not a missing rule.
- `other` — the unknown-base win32 test passed green before implementation (the token was dropped upstream → empty result), so it was not a strict red test for the over-flag path.
  Impact: none — documented in the test comment and the TDD stage notes; a true red test for over-flag would need an outside-CWD drive path under an unknown base.
  This is a manifestation of the existing package-SKILL rule ("trace the token through the classifier first"), already covered.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- None.
  Operator involvement was strategic (planning depth, sequencing choice, scope confirmation via `ask_user`), not mechanical oversight.

### Considered but not proposed

- No `AGENTS.md` change for the decorator-line edit trap — the rule already exists and is crisp; adding salience text to an already-dense file would not improve first-attempt recall.
- No `testing`-skill change for the green-before-red test — the package SKILL's "trace the token through the classifier first" already covers the underlying principle.
- No `/ship-issue` change — the `IN_PROGRESS` refinement worked; nothing to add.

### Changes made

1. Added this Final Retrospective stage entry to `packages/pi-permission-system/docs/retro/0508-bash-external-directory-windows-drive-letter.md`.
2. No `AGENTS.md`, prompt, or skill changes — operator confirmed retro-only; existing rules covered every friction point.
