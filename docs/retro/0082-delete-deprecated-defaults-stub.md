# Retro: #82 — Delete deprecated empty `defaults.ts` stub

## Final Retrospective (2026-05-05T01:30:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned, implemented, and shipped the deletion of `src/defaults.ts` and `tests/defaults.test.ts` — dead code left over from the issue #66 flat permission config format migration.
Released as v4.4.1.
Execution was fast and clean; the only friction was a markdown formatting mistake in the plan file itself.

### Observations

#### What went well

- The pre-plan grep confirming zero imports of `src/defaults.ts` was accurate — full suite (814 tests, 33 files) passed on first run after deletion with no surprises.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

1. `instruction-violation` — In the plan's Background section, wrote `#66 replaced the \`defaultPolicy\` concept...` with `#66` at the start of a line.
   The `#` prefix is parsed by markdownlint as a Markdown heading, triggering three errors (MD022 blanks-around-headings, MD025 single-title/single-h1, MD026 trailing-punctuation-in-heading).
   The pre-commit hook caught it; the autoformatter ran but could not fix it automatically.
   Manual repair: changed to `Issue #66 replaced...`.
   Impact: one failed commit, one additional fix commit.
   Self-identified?
   No — caught by the pre-commit hook (effectively user-caught).

#### What caused friction (user side)

- None — involvement was appropriately minimal for a housekeeping task.

### Changes made

None — no `AGENTS.md` or prompt changes were made (user judged the friction too minor to warrant a rule addition).
