| Windows: `permission_forwarding.error — EPERM … rename` in the logs, and a subagent's tool call refused | An antivirus scanner or the search indexer held a transient handle on a forwarding file | The write is retried automatically for a short window. If it still fails, enable `debugLog` and look for `permission_forwarding.fs_retried` entries — their `attempts` and `code` say whether retrying is helping — then exclude the forwarding directory from the scanner. |

## Diagnostic Logging

Enable `"debugLog": true` in your config to write verbose diagnostics to `logs/pi-permission-system-debug.jsonl`.

On every session start, the extension emits a `config.resolved` entry to both logs listing the resolved config paths and whether each exists.
This makes it easy to verify which files the extension actually loaded:

```jsonc
{
  "event": "config.resolved",
  "globalConfigPath": "/…/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json",
  "globalConfigExists": true,
  "projectConfigPath": "/…/my-project/.pi/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json",
  "projectConfigExists": false,
  "agentsDir": "/…/.pi/agent/agents",
  "agentsDirExists": true,
  "projectAgentsDir": "/…/my-project/.pi/agents",
  "projectAgentsDirExists": false,
  "legacyGlobalPolicyDetected": false,
  "legacyProjectPolicyDetected": false,
  "legacyExtensionConfigDetected": false
}
```

## Threat Model

**Goal:** Enforce policy at the host level, not the model level.

**What this stops:**

- Agent calling tools it shouldn't use (e.g., `write`, dangerous `bash`)
- Tool switching attempts (calling non-existent tool names)
- Accidental escalation via skill loading
- Unapproved path-bearing tool access outside the active working directory when `external_directory` is `ask` or `deny`

**Limitations:**

- If a dangerous action is possible via an allowed tool, policy must explicitly restrict it
- This is a permission decision layer, not a sandbox — for true isolation see [Agent Sandboxes](https://engine.build/lab/agent-sandboxes).
  The two are complementary rather than alternatives: a sandbox enforces which paths are in scope and in which direction, while this package decides whether a particular action on an in-scope path may proceed.
  [ADR 0013] §8 records that division and the seam that exports this package's scope decisions to a sandbox launcher.
- The review log records bash command strings, masked only where a name binds the secret.
  Log files are created owner-only (`0600`), and a value bound to a sensitive name (`authorization`, `token`, `password`, a bare or suffixed `key`, …) is masked — whether the name is a log key, a shell variable, or a request header field.
  A secret with no name bound to it, such as one typed as a `grep` pattern, is not.
  Review-log values are shortened at `reviewLogFieldMaxWidth` (1000 characters by default), which bounds the file's growth but is a length cap, not redaction.
