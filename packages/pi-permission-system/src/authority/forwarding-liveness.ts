/**
 * forwarding-liveness.ts — Is anyone draining a forwarded-permission inbox?
 *
 * The in-process answer already exists: a serving session marks itself in the
 * process-global `ServingSessionRegistry`, and an in-process child abandons a
 * target that has looked unmarked for the grace window instead of waiting out
 * the full forwarding timeout (#719).
 *
 * A child spawned as a separate `pi` process shares no `globalThis` with its
 * parent, so that mark is invisible to it and it keeps waiting the full ten
 * minutes — every `ask` forwarded to a session that has already exited costs
 * the whole timeout and ends in a denial nobody made (#735 scenario 1).
 *
 * The filesystem is the only channel those two processes share, so the serving
 * session publishes a heartbeat there: one record per serving session,
 * refreshed while it polls and withdrawn when it stops.
