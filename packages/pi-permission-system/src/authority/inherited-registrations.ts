/**
 * inherited-registrations.ts — Complete a child node's fact-shaping lookups
 * from its ancestors in the same process.
 *
 * Registrations are node-local (ADR 0012 decision 1): an extractor or formatter
 * lands in the registry of the node whose extension registered it. That is
 * unchanged here. What this module adds is the decision's fact-shaping clause —
 * a **lookup** may cross an in-process node boundary, because an extractor
 * produces a path and a formatter produces display text, and neither decides
 * anything.
 *
 * The gap it closes is the split-provider condition (#793). Excluding a package
 * from child sessions normally removes its tools and their extractors together,
 * so nothing is weakened. But when package A registers a tool whose path lives
 * under a non-standard key and package B registers the extractor for it,
 * excluding B alone leaves the child with the tool and no way to see its path:
 * the `path` and `external_directory` gates never run for that call, and the
 * parent's own gating is unaffected, so the weakening is visible nowhere.
 *
 * Why this direction is safe, and why it stops here:
 *
 * - It is monotone. Without an extractor the gate does not run at all, so
 *   resolving one can only add a check, and the four path layers compose
 *   most-restrictive-wins — an inherited extractor can never loosen a decision.
 * - It carries no authority. Live authority converges at the adjudicating node
 *   (ADR 0007 §7), so there is deliberately **no** equivalent for the authorizer
 *   registry: a link returns a verdict, and inheriting one would run authority
 *   an operator's own `excludedExtensionPackages` removed.
 *
 * In-process only, by construction: an out-of-process child shares no
 * `globalThis`, so it reaches no ancestor service, and an extractor is a
 * closure that cannot be serialized to one.
