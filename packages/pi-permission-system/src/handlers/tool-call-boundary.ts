 * try/catch — unlike `emitUserBash` directly below it, which catches and
 * continues. A thrown gate therefore yields no `{ block: true }` and the
 * command runs ungated with nothing logged. This boundary absorbs that throw,
 * blocks, and writes a `gate_error` review-log entry.
 *
 * Fail-closed = **block** (not `ask`) for an unexpected exception: the command
 * may be unknown and the prompt infrastructure itself may be what threw, so a
 * hard block is the unambiguous safe outcome.
