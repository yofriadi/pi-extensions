 * one job its name describes: filtering tools and sanitizing the prompt.
 *
 * Constructor deps:
 * - `session` — activated with the turn's context, then refreshed from disk
 * - `warmParser` — warms the tree-sitter parser so the synchronous advisory
 *   bash path can decompose at gate parity; `before_agent_start` precedes any
 *   tool call, so triggering it here closes the pre-warm window (#309)
 * - `readyAnnouncer` — re-announces `permissions:ready` once per session
 *   (ADR 0012 decision 3); `before_agent_start` runs after every extension's
 *   `session_start` and before any ask, so a consumer that registers from the
 *   ready handler alone is heard in time
