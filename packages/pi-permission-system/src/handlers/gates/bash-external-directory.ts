/**
 * Build a pure descriptor for the bash external-directory permission gate.
 *
 * Reads the external paths from the injected `BashProgram` and checks whether
 * any reference directories outside the working directory. Returns `null` when the gate
 * does not apply (not a shell invocation, no command, or no external paths found).
 * Returns a `GateBypass` when all paths are allowed (by config or session rule).
 * Returns a `GateDescriptor` with multi-pattern sessionApproval for uncovered paths.
 *
 * Each path is resolved on the narrowest `external_directory`-family surface
 * its own attributed effect names, and the session approval records one grant
 * per uncovered path at that same surface (#810) — so an ask mixing a proven
 * read with a proven write grants each path only its own direction, never both
 * on both. Two paths sharing a directory derive the same glob and so grant
 * both directions there, which is what the prompt showed.
 *
 * The shell command (native `bash` or an aliased shell tool) is read from the
 * injected `BashProgram`, which owns the source text it was parsed from, so
 * this gate does not re-derive the input field name (#574).
