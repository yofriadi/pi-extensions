   * rules naming its *target* — the case raw-token matching could not see.
   *
   * Returns `null` when the token's shape rules out a path, when the effective
   * base is unknown (no concrete directory to resolve against, so the token
   * stays unpromoted per #393 conservatism), or when nothing exists at the
   * resolved location.
   *
   * Shared by both projections so a promoted token is identical whether it is
   * being matched against `path` rules or tested against the cwd boundary.
