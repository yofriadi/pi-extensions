/**
 * What a tool invocation accesses — decided once from the tool name at the
 * point an invocation enters the system.
 *
 * This is the single dispatch point that replaces the scattered
 * `toolName === "bash"`/`"mcp"` re-derivation across the extraction consumers
 * (`input-normalizer`, `tool-input-path`, the tool-call gate pipeline, and
 * `permission-manager`'s source derivation) and the presentation consumers
 * (`tool-preview-formatter`, `permission-prompts`, the payload builders, and
 * `deriveDecisionValue`), which dispatch on {@link classifyToolKind} or
 * {@link isMcpCheck}. Adding a tool kind means editing {@link classifyToolKind}
 * plus the exhaustive switches the compiler flags — an OCP win over silent
 * `===` comparisons a new variant sails past (#561).
 *
 * The value is plain data (a string union): `tool-kind.ts` imports no
 * `AccessPath`, so `permission-manager.ts` may consume it without breaching the
 * string boundary formalized in ADR-0002
 * (`docs/decisions/0002-path-values-string-boundary.md`).
 *
 * - `bash` — its own token-based path gates; extraction product is the command.
 * - `mcp` — extraction product is the qualified target.
 * - `skill` — a distinct surface `normalizeInput`/`deriveSource` treat specially.
 * - `path` — a path-bearing built-in (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`grep`/`find`/`ls`);
 *   extraction product is `input.path`.
 * - `extension` — every other tool, plus the `external_directory`/`path` special
 *   surfaces that reach `deriveSource` as normalized names.

 * (e.g. `@howaboua/pi-codex-conversion`'s `exec_command`) is routed through the
 * same bash enforcement stack as native `bash` (#574).
 *
 * The command and workdir are read through {@link getNonEmptyString} (trimmed,
 * empty → `""`/`undefined`), matching the pipeline's existing native-bash
 * extraction. Kept separate from {@link classifyToolKind} because it needs
 * config (the alias map) and returns a richer product than a {@link ToolKind}
 * string — `classifyToolKind` stays AccessPath-free and config-free.
