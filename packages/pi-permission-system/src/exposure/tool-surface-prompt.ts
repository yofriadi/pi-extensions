/**
 * The tool-surface region of a system prompt: which tools this session may
 * call, and the guidance those tools contribute.
 *
 * Pi writes that region near the top of its preamble, a few hundred characters
 * in. `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` copies everything ahead of the skills catalogue
 * into a child's prompt verbatim, so the child's leading bytes match its
 * parent's for prefix-reusing inference engines — which means editing the
 * region in place ends that shared prefix for every child whose allowed set
 * differs from its parent's (#890).
 *
 * So the region is *relocated* rather than narrowed: the sections Pi wrote are
 * removed, and this node's own are rendered at the end of the prompt, past
 * everything a child inherits. Each session then states its own tool surface
 * and no session edits another's bytes.
 *
 * Removal is bounded to the text this package or Pi wrote. The prompt is split
 * at Pi's `Current working directory:` footer, which it writes last and
 * unconditionally: everything after it was appended by an extension, and
 * everything before it is Pi's own preamble only when Pi did not build the
 * prompt from a `customPrompt`. Under a custom prompt Pi writes no tool
 * surface at all, so a section matched above the footer is a user's or another
 * extension's — removing it destroyed their text (#919, #932).
 *
 * Rendering follows `buildSystemPrompt`'s own rules — a tool is listed only
 * when it has a snippet, and the guideline bullets are the allowed tools' own
 * `promptGuidelines` around Pi's built-in ones — so the block reads as the one
 * Pi would have written for this session's real surface.
