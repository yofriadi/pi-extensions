 * The rule that governs this renderer and no other:
 *
 * > The agent renderer identifies the call; it does not reproduce it.
 *
 * The agent authored the tool call, and the harness returns this text as that
 * call's own tool result with its arguments still in context, so echoing the
 * input back tells it nothing it did not already have. What is new is the
 * verdict: which surface gated the call, which rule matched, which of the
 * call's operands tripped it, and what the human said.
 *
 * The command is the one value never rendered — it is the payload that took
 * over the viewport in #710 and the context window on every denial. The
 * flagged element (a path, an MCP target, a skill) *is* rendered, because
 * which operand a rule fired on is below tool-call granularity and the agent
 * cannot recover it from its own arguments; being agent input, it is capped
 * rather than structurally bounded.
