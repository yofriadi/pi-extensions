/**
 * The payload facts the permission review log persists (ADR 0011 §6).
 *
 * The log is a renderer over the payload like any other, and this is its
 * content decision: the request facts, and only those the log's own structured
 * columns do not already carry. `toolName`, `command`, `path`, `target`, and
 * `toolInputPreview` are written by the gates; restating them under a second
 * name would grow the log rather than sharpen it.
 *
 * Evidence and annotations are deliberately absent.
 * `docs/decisions/0010-permission-log-secret-exposure.md` bounds what the logs
 * accumulate, and evidence is exactly the unbounded part — the point of this
 * render is that the log's growth is a decision, not a side effect of how a
 * prompt happened to be worded.
 *
 * A fact the ask does not carry is omitted rather than written as `null`, so a
 * line states what was true rather than enumerating what was not.
