/**
 * Cross-extension service accessors backed by `Symbol.for()` on `globalThis`.
 *
 * `Symbol.for()` is process-global by spec, so it survives jiti's per-extension
 * module isolation (`moduleCache: false`). A consumer doing
 * `import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system")` gets a fresh module copy, but the
 * accessors here read from the same `globalThis` slots the provider wrote to —
 * enabling direct, synchronous, type-safe function calls.
 *
 * The slot is a session-keyed map, because one process can host several
 * **nodes** (one Pi session runtime each — a root session and its in-process
 * subagent children all load their own instance of this extension). Every node
 * writes under its own session id, and `getPermissionsService(sessionId)`
 * resolves the service whose registries that node's own gates and chain read
 * (ADR 0012 decision 2).
 *
 * Best practice: resolve per use rather than caching the reference — this
 * ensures resilience across `/reload` and load-order edge cases.
