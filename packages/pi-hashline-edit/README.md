> Hash-anchored `read` and `edit` tool override for [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent) — every line carries a content hash, so edits never land on the wrong line, even when the file has changed.
>
> Inspired by [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi).

## Why

LLMs edit code by quoting the text they see on screen.
But by the time the edit runs, the file may have changed — a concurrent write, an earlier edit in the same turn, or drift from a stale read.
The hashline protocol gives every line a short content hash, so edits carry verifiable references instead of raw text.
Stale anchors are caught before they touch the file: no silent corruption, no wrong-line rewrites.

## Features

- 📖 **Hashline Read** — file content with `LINE#HASH:` prefixes, providing verifiable line-level anchors
- ✏️ **Anchored Edit** — `replace` / `append` / `prepend` / `replace_text`, all validated against content hashes before applying
- 🔍 **Grep** — ripgrep-backed search returning `LINE#HASH:` anchors, usable directly in `edit` without a prior `read` (opt-in)
- 🔗 **Chained Edits** — successful edits return fresh anchors, enabling consecutive edits without re-reading
- 🛡️ **Stale Anchor Recovery** — 3-way snapshot merge attempts automatic recovery; on failure, returns fresh anchors for immediate retry
- 🚫 **Strict by Design** — no silent relocation, no fuzzy matching, no accidental overwrites
- ⚡ **Atomic Writes** — temp-file + rename, symlink and hardlink safe

## Quick Start

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hashline-edit
```

<https://github.com/YuGiMob/pi-hashline-edit-pro> Once installed, pi's `read` and `edit` tools are replaced by hashline versions.
Reading a file will look like:

```text
 8#VR:function hello() {
 9#KT:  console.log("world");
10#BH:}
```

To edit, reference `LINE#HASH` anchors from the `read` output:

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.ts",
  "edits": [
    { "op": "replace", "pos": "9#KT", "lines": ["  console.log('hashline');"] }
  ]
}
```

If the file has changed since the last read, stale anchors are caught with explicit re-read guidance — no silent errors.

## How It Works

### `read`: tagged line output

Text files are returned with a `LINE#HASH:` prefix on every line:

- `LINE` — 1-indexed line number, left-padded for column alignment.
- `HASH` — content hash from the alphabet `ZPMQVRWSNKTXJBYH`; 2 characters by default, configurable up to 4 (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

Optional parameters: `offset` (start line), `limit` (max lines), `raw` (plain content without prefixes).

Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) are passed through as attachments.
Binary and directory paths are rejected with a descriptive error.

### `edit`: hash-anchored modifications

Edits use `LINE#HASH` anchors to target lines precisely.
All edits in a single call validate against the same pre-edit snapshot and apply bottom-up, so line numbers stay consistent.

| Op             | Purpose                                                                          | Fields                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `replace`      | Replace one line (`pos`) or an inclusive range (`pos` + `end`).                  | `pos` required, `end` optional, `lines` |
| `append`       | Insert lines after `pos`. Omit `pos` to append at EOF.                           | `pos` optional, `lines`                 |
| `prepend`      | Insert lines before `pos`. Omit `pos` to prepend at BOF.                         | `pos` optional, `lines`                 |
| `replace_text` | Replace an exact unique substring. Fails if not found or matches more than once. | `oldText`, `newText`                    |

### `grep`: hashline-anchored search

Ripgrep-backed search returning `LINE#HASH:content` anchors in the same format as `read` output.
These anchors can be passed directly into `edit`, closing the grep-to-edit loop without a separate round-trip.

- Pattern is regex by default; set `literal: true` for fixed-string search.
- Results respect `.gitignore`.
  Use `path` to scope and `glob` to filter by filename pattern.
- Set `context` (0–5) for surrounding lines; `limit` to cap matches (default 50, max 200).
- **Off by default.**
  Registered only when enabled in config (`"grep": true`) *and* `rg` is found on `PATH`.

### Chained edits

After a successful edit, the result includes an `--- Anchors A-B ---` block with fresh `LINE#HASH` references for the changed region.
These can be used directly in the next `edit` call without a full re-read, provided the next edit targets the same or nearby lines.

## Configuration

Optional.
Create `~/.pi/agent/hashline.json`:

```json
{
  "hashLength": 2,
  "grep": false,
  "replaceText": true
}
```

| Key           | Default | Range   | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hashLength`  | `2`     | 2–4     | Characters per line hash. Longer hashes reduce false-accept risk at the cost of extra tokens per line. |
| `grep`        | `false` | boolean | Register the `grep` tool (also requires ripgrep on `PATH`).                                            |
| `replaceText` | `true`  | boolean | Allow the `replace_text` op. Set `false` to enforce anchor-only edits.                                 |

The file is read once at session start.
A missing file means defaults.
Invalid values fall back to defaults with a one-time warning.

## Design Decisions

- **No fallback relocation.**
  Mismatched anchors are never silently relocated to a "close enough" line.
  This trades convenience for correctness.
- **Stale anchors: recover, then fail.**
  A hash mismatch first attempts snapshot-merge recovery (3-way merge, fuzzFactor 0).
  If the snapshot is absent or the merge conflicts, `[E_STALE_ANCHOR]` tells the model to re-read; content-matched candidates are listed only when the anchor included a text hint.
- **Strict patch content.**
  If `lines` contains display prefixes or diff markers, the edit is rejected with `[E_INVALID_PATCH]`.
  The model must send literal file content.
- **Noop loop guard.**
  Three consecutive identical no-op edits throw `[E_NOOP_LOOP]`, preventing the model from silently looping.
- **Atomic writes.**
  Files are written via temp-file-then-rename.
  Symlink chains are resolved; hard-linked files preserve the shared inode; permissions are preserved.
- **Context-based hashing.**
  Each line's hash includes its immediate neighbors (`prev + curr + next`), so identical lines in different contexts get different hashes, and editing line N only invalidates anchors for N−1, N, and N+1.

## External Read Compat (`pi-hashline-edit/compat`)

Other Pi extensions can register reads they mediated through `src/compat.ts` (versioned by `COMPAT_VERSION`, currently `1`).
The contract is verify-then-commit:

- `readNormalizedForAnnotate(path)` — reads and canonicalizes (symlinks resolved) exactly like the native read, strips the BOM, normalizes to LF, and returns `{ normalized, lines }` — **without writing the snapshot store**.
  Returns `null` when the file cannot be read as clean text (missing, binary, decoding errors).
- `commitExternalRead(path, normalized)` — registers the exact bytes the consumer verified, with the same store semantics as a native read: `rememberReadSnapshot` + `clearAppliedPayload` on the canonical path.
- `mintAnchor(fileLines, line1)` — computes the hash a native read would embed for a 1-based line number, with full-file context.
- `isHashlineEditActive()` — true once the extension has loaded; the flag is flipped in `index.ts` at extension load, so compat stays inert when the extension is not installed.

**How consumers reach this contract.**
Pi's extension loader creates a fresh module instance per extension (`moduleCache: false`), so another extension that *imports* `pi-hashline-edit/compat` gets a second copy with its own snapshot store — its commits would land in a store the `edit` tool cannot see.
`index.ts` therefore also publishes the live compat module (built in this extension's own module graph, closing over the store the edit tool reads) on the process global `globalThis.__piHashlineEditCompat` at load.
Consumers should read that entry first and fall back to the import only for same-module-tree runtimes; both paths are gated by `COMPAT_VERSION` and a runtime shape check, so drift fails safe.
