## [Unreleased]

## [2.9.0] - 2026-08-12

- **Summarizer flush pacing (behavioral default change: fan-out width `N` → `4`).** A budget auto-flush drains the whole pending backlog in one fan-out, and `summarizeBatches` previously fired every batch's LLM call at once through an unbounded `Promise.all` - an observed 34-batch flush tripped provider rate limiting (`Cloud Code Assist API error (429): Resource has been exhausted`), and the resulting transients flipped the configured `summarizerModel` into sticky session-model fallback for the rest of the flush. The fan-out now runs a bounded worker pool of `contextPrune.summarizerConcurrency` workers (default `4`; **`0` restores the previous unbounded behavior**), with results still index-aligned and per-batch progress semantics unchanged. Rate-limit-shaped failures (HTTP 429, `resource has been exhausted`, quota/rate-limit/overloaded wording, server retry-delay phrases) are additionally retried **in place on the same model** with bounded backoff (2 extra attempts, 2s exponential base, 30s per-wait cap - internal constants, not user config; an over-cap server delay short-circuits straight to the existing transient/fallback path), and a per-fan-out rate-limit gate coordinates a shared backoff window across the pool. Pacing is silent (no new notifications) and sits below the fallback controller, whose behavior and wording are untouched. New `/pruner` settings overlay row (`1` / `2` / `4 (default)` / `8` / `0 (unbounded)`); documented in README, `doc/configuration.md`, and PRUNING.md.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-05

- **Removed the main-loop thinking strip (breaking: `contextPrune.thinkingStrip.*` no longer read).** The feature assumed thinking blocks we send are thinking blocks we are billed for. Verified against the live Anthropic API (`count_tokens` and real billed usage agree to the token), the actual rule is: thinking in a *closed* cycle bills 0 input tokens, and thinking in an *open* cycle survives only as an unbroken run starting at the cycle's first assistant turn — any gap discards everything after it. `keepLastTurns` kept the **last** K, so firing it punched a gap at the front and the API dropped all of it: the model received no thinking either way, and the no-gap → gap transition cost a full cache invalidation (measured +33% in a controlled 24-tool-call A/B, $0.6430 → $0.8531, with turn 17 rewriting 63113 tokens at 0% reuse). Across 58 sessions / 1233 open cycles the strip fired 253 times and reached its ~130-turn break-even twice. It was also redundant: chain compression's synthetic block is a `role: "user"` text message, which closes the cycle and frees all prior thinking server-side at zero cache cost. `pruneMessages` drops to three phases (`stub-replace → error-purge → chain-range-prune`); `src/thinking-strip.ts`, `ThinkingStripConfig`, `KEEP_LAST_TURNS_PRESETS`, the two `/pruner` settings entries, and `PruneFrontier.thinkingStripBoundaryTimestamp` are gone. A leftover `thinkingStrip` block in `settings.json` is inert and round-trips untouched (`normalize()` never filters unknown keys); a persisted `context-prune-frontier` entry carrying the old boundary field loads and is ignored. Rationale and measurements: `doc/specs/2026-08-05-remove-thinking-strip.md`.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-08-04

- **Flush-gated, timestamp-keyed thinking strip ([#3](https://github.com/jjuraszek/pi-condense/issues/3)).** Phase 4 (`stripOldThinking`, `src/thinking-strip.ts`) recomputed its keep-window from the *live assistant count on every `context` render*, so each turn the `(count - keepLastTurns)`-th assistant slid forward and its thinking was stripped **deep in history**. pi-ai sets prompt-cache breakpoints only at `tools + system + last message` (verified in `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `api/anthropic-messages.js` `convertMessages` - no in-history breakpoint), so every deep mutation busted the cached suffix - roughly every render inside a tool loop. The strip boundary is now a **flush-computed, persisted assistant-message timestamp** (`thinkingStripBoundaryTimestamp`, added to the `PruneFrontier` snapshot on the existing `context-prune-frontier` entry): fixed between flushes so consecutive renders are byte-stable in their historical prefix (the cache survives a whole tool loop), advancing only on a non-empty flush (piggybacking summarization's own cache bust - zero marginal busts), monotonically clamped (never re-adds thinking to an already-stripped message, even when `keepLastTurns` is increased mid-session), and keyed by timestamp rather than array index so it is robust to phase-3 chain-range middle drops. An absent boundary (pre-feature sessions, pre-first-flush) falls back to the original live-count window verbatim. Additive optional field, fully backward-compatible; **no new config key**, `keepLastTurns` presets unchanged. `PRUNING.md` cache-impact model corrected. Turns the old k-busts-per-render into ~1-per-request.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-08-04

- **No-op renders skip context serialization.** `pruneMessages` (`src/pruner.ts`) computed `sizeMessages` (a full `JSON.stringify` over the entire message array) unconditionally on every `context` render, including no-ops where the result is never read (`index.ts` consumes `beforeChars`/`afterChars` only under `if (result.pruned)`). It now computes both sizes lazily in the pruned branch and returns a `{ beforeChars: 0, afterChars: 0 }` sentinel on a no-op, so a render that prunes nothing does zero `JSON.stringify` over the array. CPU/GC only - zero token cost, no wire or return-shape change. Also corrects a stale fast-path comment in the `context` handler (`index.ts`): index/registry emptiness alone does not imply a no-op, because error-purge and thinking-strip prune independently.
- **Bumped `engines.node` to `>=22.19.0`** to match the host pi runtime (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.83.0`); drops advertised support for Node 20/21, which cannot run current pi. Bumped the `@sinclair/typebox` devDependency floor to `^0.34.52` (freshness only; the caret already resolved there).

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-30

- **Fix 421 Misdirected Request for GitHub Copilot business/enterprise seats.** The summarizer called pi-ai's `stream()` with the static model definition, whose shipped `baseUrl` pins the individual Copilot host (`api.individual.githubcopilot.com`); business/enterprise tokens are rejected there with `421 Misdirected Request`, so any `github-copilot/*` `summarizerModel` failed on those seats. `runOnce` now mirrors the main agent loop (pi's `model-runtime`): it resolves provider auth via `ctx.modelRegistry.getProviderAuth(model.provider)` and, when the resolved auth carries a seat-specific `baseUrl`, rebases the model onto it before streaming. Also bumps `@earendil-works/*` devDependencies to `^0.83.0` (needed for `getProviderAuth` on the extension-facing `ModelRegistry`) and imports `stream` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` (its export moved off the root in current pi-ai).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-09

- **Summarizer call timeout.** Every summarizer stream call is now bounded by an idle timeout (`summarizerIdleTimeoutMs`, default 20s - reset on every stream event, so it never false-aborts a flowing or reasoning generation) and a total-duration ceiling (`summarizerMaxTimeoutMs`, default 180s). Previously a stalled-but-open provider connection hung the whole agent turn indefinitely, since `runOnce` had no time budget and the automatic flush paths pass no abort signal. A timeout classifies as transient and feeds the existing outage-fallback retry (one bounded session-model attempt when a distinct `summarizerModel` is set), then surfaces a `warning` notice. Both timers are `0`-disablable and exposed in `/pruner settings` and `/pruner status`.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-06

- **Recovery grace window for `context_tree_query` output.** The pruner used to re-stub its own recovery output at the next turn boundary, forcing a retrieve -> re-stub -> re-query loop the agent experiences as "fighting the pruner" (observed in a real session: a recovered tool dump was re-summarized on the very next flush, so the agent had to keep re-querying the same ref). A new `recoveryGraceTurns` setting (default `3`, `0` disables) keeps a recovered output verbatim for that many user-turn-groups before reverting to the stub. Enforced at **render time** in two places - Phase 1 stub-replace (`src/pruner.ts`) and chain-compression eligibility (`src/chain-compressor.ts`, which defers compressing any chain whose span still holds an in-grace recovery id) - never at capture, so the frontier, dedup, spill, and live `turn_end` paths are unchanged. The window is computed positionally from the message stream (no new `ToolCallRecord` field). Default `3` covers ~81% of same-ref re-queries observed in the local session corpus; the accepted trade-off is that a reference past the window is re-stubbed and may be re-queried, keeping context regrowth bounded rather than permanent. Tunable via `/pruner recovery-grace [n]` and the `/pruner settings` overlay. See [PRUNING.md § What Pruning Does](PRUNING.md#what-pruning-does).

## [2.2.1] - 2026-07-06

- **Fix probe starvation in the summarizer outage fallback.** `FallbackController.onFallbackOnlyFail` reset the re-probe cooldown on every steady-state fallback failure, so a fallback (session) model that failed at least once per 10-minute cooldown perpetually pushed out the primary re-probe - a recovered `summarizerModel` was never re-tested and summarization stayed on the pricier session model indefinitely (the exact stall the feature exists to kill, in the fallback direction). The method is now a no-op on `lastProbeAt`: the primary re-probe fires on schedule regardless of fallback failures. In-memory only; no wire/config change.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-06

- **Summarizer outage fallback to the session model.** Per-model provider outages (e.g. a cheap `summarizerModel` like Haiku degraded while the session's main model stays healthy) previously stalled pruning for the whole outage - `runSummarization` returned null and the batch retried the same dead model every flush, growing context unbounded. A new sticky in-memory `FallbackController` (`src/summarizer-fallback.ts`) now routes summarization to `ctx.model` on a **transient** failure of the configured model, retrying the failed call once on the session model. Fallback is sticky: while engaged, all calls use the session model until a single probe batch re-tests the configured model after a 10-minute cooldown, then auto-recovers. Trigger is transient-only - auth (pre-flight key failure), unusable (empty/truncated), and abort never trip it. A one-time `warning` fires on enter and an `info` on recovery via `ctx.ui.notify` (UI only, never injected into LLM context). No config key: the target is always `ctx.model`, and the controller is inert when no distinct fallback model exists (`summarizerModel: default` or the resolved model equals `ctx.model`), preserving today's single-attempt behavior byte-for-byte. State is in-memory only (reset on `session_start`, no `context-prune-*` entry).

## [2.1.2] - 2026-07-05

Branding, funding, and gallery preview. No behavior change.

### Added

- **Logo + pi.dev gallery preview.** Repo-root `pi-condense.png` (640x640), shown in the README and wired as `pi.image`.
- **Buy Me a Coffee funding.** `funding` in `package.json`, `.github/FUNDING.yml`, and a README badge.

### Changed

- Sharpened `description`; added `context-pruning`, `llm`, `prompt-caching` keywords.
- README reframed product-first (credit to `championswimmer/pi-context-prune` kept as attribution); fixed a stale `pi-superpowers` -> `pi-gauntlet` reference in a spec doc.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-04

- **`release.yml` posts GitHub Release notes.** A new `release-notes` job (`needs: publish`, `contents: write`) extracts the CHANGELOG section matching the pushed tag with `awk` (skipping `## [Unreleased]`) and publishes it as the GitHub Release body via `gh release create` (falling back to `gh release edit`). No LLM or API key; only `github.token`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-04

- **Per-bullet recovery refs in prune summaries** (closes #2). Each per-tool block in a summary now carries its own inline `` `tN` `` ref, so the model recovers a specific tool's raw output in one hop instead of guessing which flat-footer ref maps to which bullet. The serializer labels each tool block `[[N:toolname]]` (`src/batch-capture.ts`), the summarizer prompt tells the model to copy that label onto its first bullet (`src/summarizer.ts`), and `substituteInlineRefs` (`src/summary-refs.ts`) validates the echoed tool name against the tool at position N before rewriting to `` `tN` ``. The flat footer is retained unchanged as the always-correct fallback. Deterministic number->shortId map over the shared post-dedup `batch.toolCalls` order; the tool-name tag downgrades a confident wrong-ref (skip-induced renumber) to footer-only, and mismatched / out-of-range / wrapped / mid-line labels are stripped (fence-aware leak guard) so no raw `[[N:name]]` token ever leaks into context. No new tool, config key, or index.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-03

- **Prune summaries are now hidden from Pi's main window** (`display: false` at both injection sites in `index.ts`). They stay in LLM context and session history (recoverable via `context_tree_query`) but no longer print the full markdown block into the TUI. Mirrors upstream `pi-context-prune` `2fd6127`.
- **Sharpened the summarizer prompt** (`src/summarizer.ts`): the key-outcome bullet now requires copying file paths, identifiers, signatures, and error strings *verbatim* (never reworded), and the summarizer skips tool calls that succeeded with nothing reusable to record. Scoped to short tokens - values/full output stay summarized, so the ~8x median compression and the oversized guard are unaffected.
- **`context_tree_query` description now shows a literal call example** (`{ toolCallIds: ["t12", "t3"] }`) and consolidates the two near-duplicate parameter descriptions into one that marks the field required. Reduces the empty-first-call retry seen in real sessions. No schema or behavior change.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-02

- **Renamed the package `pi-context-prune` -> `pi-condense`** and switched distribution from git-tag pins to npm. Install with `pi install npm:pi-condense` (was `git:github.com/jjuraszek/pi-context-prune@vX.Y.Z`). Migrate pinned `settings.json` entries; `release.sh sync-presets` reports stale pins.
- **Added npm release machinery:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` (tag-triggered, OIDC + provenance, `tag == package.json` gate) and `test.yml` (bun, Ubuntu + Windows matrix). Ported `release.sh` to the shared sibling skeleton (`propose` / `patch|minor|major` / `current` / `verify` / `sync-presets`), replacing the old tag-pin `release.mjs`.
- **Added** `LICENSE` (MIT), `files` allowlist, `engines`, and `author` to `package.json`; removed dead `pi.skills` / `pi.prompts` manifest entries (those directories never existed).
- **Renamed** the cost-event producer id `EXTERNAL_COST_SOURCE` `"pi-context-prune"` -> `"pi-condense"`. Aggregators keyed on the old `source` string see it as a new producer.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-31

- **Removed three `pruneOn` modes**, leaving `agent-message` (default) and `on-demand`:
  - `every-turn` - debugging-only trigger with the worst prompt-cache churn.
  - `on-context-tag` - depended on the external `ttttmr/pi-context` extension and overlapped its `context_compact`.
  - `agentic-auto` - the scaffolded DCP-style model-driven `context_prune` tool was never wired to range compression (see `PRUNING.md`, Future Work).
- **Removed** the `context_prune` tool, the agentic-auto system prompt, the `<pruner-note>` unpruned-count reminder, and the `remindUnprunedCount` setting. Deleted `src/reminder.ts`, `src/context-prune-tool.ts`, `src/progress-text.ts`.
- **Migration:** none required. Configs pinned to a removed mode fall back to `agent-message` via `isPruneOn()`. A stale `remindUnprunedCount` key in `settings.json` is ignored.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-28

- **Release flow:** `release.sh` now rewrites every `~/.pi/agent*/settings.json` pin of `git:github.com/jjuraszek/pi-context-prune@<ref>` to the new `@vX.Y.Z` automatically after pushing the tag. Opt out with `--no-update-pins`. Aligns this fork's release workflow with sibling pi-* packages.
- **Docs:** `README.md` install section leads with the jjuraszek tag-pin (was upstream npm/sha references). `AGENTS.md` release blurb updated to reflect tag pins + automatic settings rewrite. `.agents/skills/release/SKILL.md` documents the new flow + flags. Adds this `CHANGELOG.md` for parity with sibling pi-* packages.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-28

- **Pre-flush pipeline:** content-hash dedup (re-reads of identical `(toolName, content)` pairs alias the original instead of going through the LLM), trivial-batch skip (`minBatchChars`), protected tools allowlist, stub-replace rather than delete. See `PRUNING.md`, Pre-flush Pipeline & Safeguards.
- **Settings:** moved to `<agent-dir>/settings.json#contextPrune` namespace (was a separate file). Honors `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-11

- `quietOversizedSkips` setting to suppress `skipped-oversized` notifications.
- Demote oversized-skip notification severity to info.
- Use short refs in pruned summaries (e.g. `t1`, `t2` rather than full toolCallIds) so the model can pass them back through `context_tree_query` more reliably.
