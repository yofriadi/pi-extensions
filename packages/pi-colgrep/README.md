Pi extension that integrates [ColGrep](https://github.com/lightonai/next-plaid#colgrep) semantic code search as a tool available to the agent.

ColGrep is a fully local semantic code search CLI built on multi-vector ColBERT embeddings and tree-sitter parsing.
It combines regex filtering with semantic ranking, supports 25 languages, and runs entirely on the user's machine.
This package exposes ColGrep as a Pi tool that complements (not replaces) the built-in `grep`.

## Fork notes (this copy)

Fork of [`@gotgenes/pi-colgrep`](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/tree/main/packages/pi-colgrep) v1.5.3 by Chris Lasher (MIT, see `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`).
Upstream remains the source of truth for search behaviour; this fork exists to carry local changes that should not wait on upstream.

## Changes from upstream

1. `skills/colgrep/SKILL.md` sets `disable-model-invocation: true`.
   The skill guidance is documentation the model fetches on demand rather than an always-resident entry in `<available_skills>`; the `colgrep` tool itself is unaffected.
   Rationale: the tool-selection rule already lives in the system prompt, so the resident entry duplicated it at ~55 tokens per session.
2. `typebox` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` — it is imported at runtime by `src/tools/colgrep.ts`, which only worked upstream because the npm install tree happened to resolve it.

## Updating from upstream

```bash
gh repo clone gotgenes/pi-packages /tmp/pup -- --depth 1
rsync -a --delete /tmp/pup/packages/pi-colgrep/src/ packages/pi-colgrep/src/
# keep the forked skills/ + package.json deltas, then re-check
```

## Prerequisites

- [ColGrep](https://github.com/lightonai/next-plaid#colgrep) installed and available on `PATH`
- Node.js ≥ 22

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@gotgenes/pi-colgrep
```

Or add it to your Pi settings (`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "packages": ["npm:@gotgenes/pi-colgrep"]
}
```

## Indexing

The extension keeps a semantic index current for the agent:

- On session start it builds the index in the **background** (`colgrep init`), so it never blocks Pi startup.
- After each successful `write`/`edit` it schedules a debounced reindex — but only when an index already exists for the directory, so a directory you never search is never indexed proactively.
- Run `/colgrep-reindex` to build or refresh the index on demand.
  This also re-enables the write/edit auto-reindex for the rest of the session.

If no index exists and startup indexing is disabled, the extension skips the auto-reindex and notifies you once.
A real `colgrep` search still auto-indexes on demand regardless.

## Configuration

Optional configuration is read from a JSON file at two locations, with the project file overriding the global one:

| Scope   | Path                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Global  | `<agentDir>/extensions/pi-colgrep/config.json` |
| Project | `<cwd>/.pi/extensions/pi-colgrep/config.json`  |

| Key              | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `indexOnStartup` | boolean | `true`  | Build the index in the background on session start. Set to `false` to skip startup indexing entirely (the index is then built lazily on the first real search or via `/colgrep-reindex`). |

Example — disable startup indexing for a large non-code directory:

```json
{
  "indexOnStartup": false
}
```

A missing config file is fine (defaults apply); a malformed file is ignored with a warning.

## Scope and non-goals

**Purpose.**
The built-in `grep` finds text matching a pattern, but not code by intent when you do not know the exact wording.
This extension exposes the external ColGrep CLI as an agent tool and keeps its index warm across a session.

**In scope.**
The tool surface, the index lifecycle, and agent guidance about when semantic search is the right instrument.

**Non-goals.**

- _Replacing `grep`._
  Exact string, regex, and symbol matching stay with the built-in tools; the shipped skill exists to stop the agent defaulting to semantic search for everything.
- _Owning the ColGrep binary._
  It is a user-supplied prerequisite — not bundled, installed, patched, or vendored — and a CLI bug is reported upstream.
  ColGrep is the backend, not one of several interchangeable engines.
- _Blocking startup on indexing._
  Startup indexing is fire-and-forget, so a session is usable immediately.
- _Indexing a directory nobody searched._
  Auto-reindex is gated on an index already existing, and there are no trigger heuristics beyond that plus one `indexOnStartup` boolean.
- _Full CLI parity._
  The tool exposes a curated parameter subset; other flags remain reachable by running `colgrep` through `bash`.

**Where adjacent requests belong.**
Exact pattern or symbol matching → the built-in `grep`.
Finding files by name → the built-in `find`.
Advanced filtering and multi-directory search → `colgrep` invoked through `bash`.
