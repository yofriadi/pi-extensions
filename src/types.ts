/**
 * Shared types for the context-prune extension.
 *
 * Design decisions (Phase 1):
 *
 * SUMMARIZATION BATCH (Ph1 step 2):
 *   One batch = one completed assistant turn with tool calls, captured from
 *   the `turn_end` event when event.toolResults.length > 0.
 *   event.message = AssistantMessage (contains ToolCall content blocks with ids)
 *   event.toolResults = ToolResultMessage[] (one per tool call in this turn)
 *
 * STATE MODEL (Ph1 step 3):
 *   - Runtime state: Map<occurrenceKey, ToolCallRecord> rebuilt on session_start
 *   - Session metadata: pi.appendEntry("context-prune-index", IndexEntryData)
 *     stored once per summarized batch; NOT in LLM context
 *   - User config: .pi/settings.json → "contextPrune" key (JSON merge safe,
 *     Pi preserves unknown keys when rewriting settings files)
 *
 * CONFIG FORMAT (Ph1 step 4):
 *   { "contextPrune": { "enabled": false, "summarizerModel": "default", "showPruneStatusLine": true } }
 *   summarizerModel: "default" = use current active model (ctx.model)
 *                   "provider/model-id" = explicit model via ctx.modelRegistry.find()
 *
 * SUMMARY MESSAGE FORMAT (Ph1 step 5):
 *   customType: "context-prune-summary"
 *   content: markdown with one bullet per tool call + short-id footer
 *   details: SummaryMessageDetails (toolCallRefs, toolNames, turnIndex, timestamp)
 *   The content itself includes short alias IDs in plain text so the model can
 *   reference them in future context_tree_query calls without needing details.
 *
 * API CONSTRAINTS (Ph1 step 6):
 *   - Pruning MUST happen in the `context` event via { messages: filtered },
 *     never by mutating session history (pi.appendEntry / session file untouched)
 *   - Summary injection uses pi.sendMessage(..., { deliverAs: "steer" }) from
 *     inside the turn_end handler so it lands before the next LLM call
 *   - Original full tool outputs are preserved in IndexEntryData (session custom
 *     entries) and accessible via context_tree_query at any time
 *   - v1 prunes only ToolResultMessage entries; the AssistantMessage tool-call
 *     blocks (which carry the toolCallIds) are intentionally kept so the model
 *     can still reference them when calling context_tree_query
 *   - "default" summarizer = ctx.model (current active model + its credentials),
 *     NOT a hidden side-channel. It makes an explicit LLM call from turn_end.
