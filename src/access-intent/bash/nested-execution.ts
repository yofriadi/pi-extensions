 * `echo hi > $(rm x)` with the `file_redirect` as a *sibling* of the `command`,
 * so a consumer that abandons the redirect never sees the substitution inside
 * it — the bypass #741 fixed.
 *
 * An interpolating heredoc body is the second case: `cat <<EOF` with `$(rm e)`
 * in the body really runs `rm e`. Quoting needs no special handling here —
 * tree-sitter-bash emits a `command_substitution` node under `heredoc_body`
 * only for a bare `<<EOF`, never for `<<'EOF'` or `<<"EOF"`, so the parser
 * already encodes the interpolation rule.
 *

 * executions"; each consumer keeps its own handling of the destination tokens.
