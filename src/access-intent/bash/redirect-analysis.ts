/**
 * What a redirect node in the parse tree proves.
 *
 * `command-effects.ts` owns the operator *table* — which spelling means read,
 * which means write — and this module owns reading a `file_redirect` node well
 * enough to consult it: finding the operator among the node's children, and
 * telling a destination that names a file from one that names a descriptor.
 *
 * The split exists because two callers need different answers from the same
 * read, and — importantly — they need them under different burdens of proof.
 * The token collector asks what effect to *attribute* to a destination it is
 * about to emit, so it answers with a proof. The command enumerator asks
 * whether it is safe to *remove* the wrapper floor, so it answers with a
 * refusal: anything it cannot resolve counts against the exemption (#803).
 * One reader of the node keeps the two from drifting on what a redirect is.
 *
 * The two burdens meet at one fact: whether the parse resolved at all. Both
 * answers ask `parseUnresolvedAt`, so a syntax form the grammar could not
 * handle cannot be a proof to one caller and a resolvable read to the other
 * (#814).

/**
 * The effect `redirect` proves for `destination`, or `null` when the redirect
 * names no file and no token should be collected.
 *
 * `>&` and `<&` are the two operators that may name either a file descriptor
 * (`2>&1`) or a real file (`cmd >& out`); the destination node's type is the
 * parse-tree fact that tells them apart.
 *
 * A redirect the parse could not resolve proves nothing — ADR 0013 §10's base
 * case, which consults both directional surfaces. Reading a proof off whichever
 * operator survived error recovery made `cat <> rw.txt` a read and
 * `cat <> ~/rw.txt` a write, so one command's answer was a function of its
 * filename, and the read half was a fail-open on a destination the shell may
 * truncate (#814).
 *
 * The demotion applies to a *proof*, never to the `null`: a descriptor
 * duplication names no file whatever the operator around it did, so demoting
 * first would emit a descriptor number as a path candidate.

/**
 * True unless `redirect` provably only reads — the fail-closed question the

 *
 * Deliberately **not** the negation of a write proof. A destination this module
 * cannot resolve counts as a write here, because the caller is deciding whether
 * to remove a guard: `> $OUT`, `>${OUT}`, and `> $(mktemp)` name a file chosen
 * at run time, and the parse can say nothing about which. Reading those as "no
 * write proved, therefore no write" would hand the exemption to exactly the
 * shapes least visible to every other surface — the path projection does not
 * collect them either (#609).
 *
 * An unresolved parse is refused up front rather than left to the loop. The
 * loop would usually reach the same answer — a demoted destination is unproven,
 * which is not a read — but `cat <>&1` parses to a redirect whose only children
 * are the operator and a descriptor, so the loop finds nothing to refuse on and
 * clears the exemption for a form nobody understood (#814).
 *
 * Past that, only two things clear it: a descriptor duplication (`2>&1`), which
 * names no file, and an operator that proves a read — reading a file alongside
 * a pure reader leaves it a pure reader.
