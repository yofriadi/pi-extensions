 *   — the session id and the chain role — on the ready channel, and re-arms the
 *   latch so the turn about to start announces once more.
 * - `announceReady` is that second announcement: it fires at most once per
 *   activation cycle, so `permissions:ready` reaches a consumer whose own
 *   `session_start` ran after this node's (ADR 0012 decision 3). The channel's
 *   contract is therefore "at least once per session, and may repeat" —
 *   handlers must be idempotent.
