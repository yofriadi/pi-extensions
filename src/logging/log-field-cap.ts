/**
 * The permission review log's width bound (ADR 0011 §6).
 *
 * The log renders the prompt payload under its own configured limits, and this
 * is the limit: every string it writes is narrowed to a configured width. The
 * bound is applied at `writeLine`, the single place a log line is produced, so
 * a write path cannot be added that escapes it — the same discipline redaction
 * already has there.
 *
 * A cap is not redaction, and the two must not be conflated
 * (`docs/decisions/0010-permission-log-secret-exposure.md`). This narrows by
 * length alone and never reads a value to decide what to shorten; redaction
 * masks a value because of the key name it is bound to, and still does, so a
 * sensitive-keyed value is masked whole however long it was.
