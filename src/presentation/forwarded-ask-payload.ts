 * bash ask reading `command : …` exactly as a local one does (ADR 0011 §2).
 *
 * A request carrying no payload renders from whatever it does hold: fail-closed
 * applies to presentation as it does to policy, so a version-skewed ask still
 * reaches the human rather than resolving without one (ADR 0011 §9).
