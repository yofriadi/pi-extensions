/**
 * Registry for named live-authority chain links (ADR 0007 §4).
 *
 * A downstream extension offers a named `Authorizer` link via
 * `PermissionsService.registerAuthorizer`; this registry stores the link's
 * `authorize` callback so composition can bind names to capabilities. One link
 * per name; duplicate registration throws.
 *
 * Registration alone grants no authority — a link decides nothing until the
 * operator names it in the `authorizerChain` config (the opt-in activation
 * model). `AuthorizerSelection` owns that config-order resolution; this registry
 * is storage only.
 *
 * A node that relays its asks runs no chain at all (ADR 0007 §7), so a link
 * registered there is accepted and never consulted — the vacant link cell.
 * {@link ObservedAuthorizerRegistrar} records that fact rather than refusing
 * the registration (ADR 0012 decision 4).
