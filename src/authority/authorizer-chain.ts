/**
 * Compose the live-authority chain (ADR 0007): try each non-terminal `link`
 * in order, and on `defer` fall through to the next link, ending at the
 * context-selected `terminal` that always decides.
 *
 * The signature is the type-level terminal-cannot-defer invariant: `links` are
 * deferring {@link NamedAuthorizer}s while `terminal` is a
 * {@link TerminalAuthorizer} (returns a full decision), so a deferring link
 * cannot occupy the terminal slot.
 *
 * Each link is handed the session-scoped `query` and the review-log `log` at
 * `authorize` time (ADR 0007 §3) so it queries the deterministic engine at gate
 * parity and records its decision trail; the terminal receives neither. With
 * zero links the composed chain **is** the terminal instance (identity), so
 * behavior is byte-identical to the pre-chain spine — the empty-links case that
 * ships until a link registers.
